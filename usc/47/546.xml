Renewal(a) Commencement of proceedings; public notice and participation(1) A franchising authority may, on its own initiative during the 6-month period which begins with the 36th month before the franchise expiration, commence a proceeding which affords the public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of (A) identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests, and (B) reviewing the performance of the cable operator under the franchise during the then current franchise term. If the cable operator submits, during such 6-month period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of such a proceeding, the franchising authority shall commence such a proceeding not later than 6 months after the date such notice is submitted.

(2) The cable operator may not invoke the renewal procedures set forth in subsections (b) through (g) unless—(A) such a proceeding is requested by the cable operator by timely submission of such notice; or

(B) such a proceeding is commenced by the franchising authority on its own initiative.



(b) Submission of renewal proposals; contents; time(1) Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection (a), a cable operator seeking renewal of a franchise may, on its own initiative or at the request of a franchising authority, submit a proposal for renewal.

(2) Subject to section 544 of this title, any such proposal shall contain such material as the franchising authority may require, including proposals for an upgrade of the cable system.

(3) The franchising authority may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted.

A franchising authority may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under subsection (c)(1)(A) or on events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) in any case in which a violation of the franchise or the events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) occur after the effective date of this subchapter unless the franchising authority has provided the operator with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the franchising authority has waived its right to object, or the cable operator gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the franchising authority </akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_546_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Judicial review; grounds for relief</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Judicial review; grounds for relief</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_546_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Finality of administrative decision</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Finality of administrative decision Any decision of a franchising authority on a proposal for renewal shall not be considered final unless all administrative review by the State has occurred or the opportunity therefor has lapsed.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_546_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>“Franchise expiration” defined</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) “Franchise expiration” defined For purposes of this section, the term “franchise expiration” means the date of the expiration of the term of the franchise, as provided under the franchise, as it was in effect on October 30, 1984.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_546_h"><akn:num>(h)</akn:num><akn:heading>Alternative renewal procedures</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(h) Alternative renewal procedures Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section, a cable operator may submit a proposal for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to this subsection at any time, and a franchising authority may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time (including after proceedings pursuant to this section have commenced).
