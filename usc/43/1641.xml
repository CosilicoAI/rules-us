(b) “Core” townships, etc.(1)(A) Except to the extent that conveyance of a surface estate would be inconsistent with section 12(a), 14(a), 14(b), or 22(l) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1611(a), 1613(a), 1613(b), or 1621(l)], subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation for a Native Village which is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for land under section 11 or 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1610 or 1615] and which did not elect to acquire a former reserve under section 19(b) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1618(b)], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the surface estate in the public lands, as defined in such Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], in the township or townships withdrawn pursuant to section 11(a)(1) or 16(a) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1) or 1615(a)] in which all or any part of such Village is located.
