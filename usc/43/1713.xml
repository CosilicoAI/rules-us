Sales of public land tracts(a) Criteria for disposal; excepted landsA tract of the public lands (except land in units of the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems, and National System of Trails) may be sold under this Act where, as a result of land use planning required under section 1712 of this title, the Secretary determines that the sale of such tract meets the following disposal criteria:(1) such tract because of its location or other characteristics is difficult and uneconomic to manage as part of the public lands, and is not suitable for management by another Federal department or agency; or

(2) such tract was acquired for a specific purpose and the tract is no longer required for that or any other Federal purpose; or

(3) disposal of such tract will serve important public objectives, including but not limited to, expansion of communities and economic development, which cannot be achieved prudently or feasibly on land other than public land and which outweigh other public objectives and values, including, but not limited to, recreation and scenic values, which would be served by maintaining such tract in Federal ownership.


(b) Conveyance of land of agricultural value and desert in characterWhere the Secretary determines that land to be conveyed under clause (3) of subsection (a) of this section is of agricultural value and is desert in character, such land shall be conveyed either under the sale authority of this section or in accordance with other existing law.


(c) Congressional approval procedures applicable to tracts in excess of two thousand five hundred acresWhere a tract of the public lands in excess of two thousand five hundred acres has been designated for sale, such sale may be made only after the end of the ninety days (not counting days on which the House of Representatives or the Senate has adjourned for more than three consecutive days) beginning on the day the Secretary has submitted notice</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1713_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Criteria for disposal; excepted lands</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Criteria for disposal; excepted lands A tract of the public lands (except land in units of the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems, and National System of Trails) may be sold under this Act where, as a result of land use planning required under section 1712 of this title, the Secretary determines that the sale of such tract meets the following disposal criteria:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1713_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Conveyance of land of agricultural value and desert in character</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Conveyance of land of agricultural value and desert in character Where the Secretary determines that land to be conveyed under clause (3) of subsection (a) of this section is of agricultural value and is desert in character, such land shall be conveyed either under the sale authority of this section or in accordance with other existing law.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1713_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Congressional approval procedures applicable to tracts in excess of two thousand five hundred acres</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Congressional approval procedures applicable to tracts in excess of two thousand five hundred acres Where a tract of the public lands in excess of two thousand five hundred acres has been designated for sale, such sale may be made only after the end of the ninety days (not counting days on which the House of Representatives or the Senate has adjourned for more than three consecutive days) beginning on the day the Secretary has submitted notice of such designation to the Senate and the House of Representatives, and then only if the Congress has not adopted a concurrent resolution stating that such House does not approve of such designation.

Prior to the expiration of such periods the Secretary may refuse to accept any offer or may withdraw any land or interest in land from sale under this section when he determines that consummation of the sale would not be consistent with this Act or other applicable law.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
