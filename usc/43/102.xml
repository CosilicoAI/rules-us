Editorial Notes
Codification
The original text of this section referred to both registers and receivers, but reference to the latter was omitted in view of the abolition of such office under acts Oct. 28, 1921, and Mar. 3, 1925, which provided for the consolidation of the two offices under a register only. See, also, Transfer of Functions note below.
