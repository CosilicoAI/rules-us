In determining the relative priority of implementing additional units or new self-contained portions of units authorized by section 1592 of this title, the Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may be, shall give preference to those additional units or new self-contained portions of units which reduce salinity of the Colorado River at the least cost per unit of salinity reduction.
