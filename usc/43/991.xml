Title of purchasers of unconfirmed lands in Arkansas confirmed
The title of all persons who had, on April 29, 1898, purchased from the State of Arkansas any unconfirmed swamp land and held deeds for the same, is confirmed and made valid as against any claim or right of the United States, and without the payment by said persons, their heirs or assigns, of any sum whatever to the United States or to the State or Arkansas.
The State of Arkansas does hereby relinquish and quitclaim to the United States all lands prior to April 29, 1898, confirmed, certified, or patented to the State which have been entered under the public land laws; and does cede, relinquish, and quitclaim to the United States all right, title, and interest under the Acts of September 28, 1850, March 2, 1855, and March 3, 1857, in and to all lands in the State which have been heretofore granted, confirmed, certified, or patented by the United States under any other Acts, and the title to such lands is confirmed in the grantees, their heirs, successors, or assigns, anything in this section or any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding: Provided, That this section shall be of no force or effect until the State of Arkansas shall have accepted and approved the conditions, limitations, and provisions herein contained by an act of the general assembly or by an instrument in writing duly executed by the governor under the authority conferred upon him by the legislature of said State, and filed with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior within one year from April 29, 1898: Provided further, That whereas the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas did, on the 10th day of March, 1897, accept and approve the conditions, limitations, and provisions herein contained before April 29, 1898, making the same effective and conclusive, therefore this section shall be in full force and effect from and after April 29, 1898.
(Apr. 29, 1898, ch. 229, §§ 3, 4, 30 Stat. 368.)
