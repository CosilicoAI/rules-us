Congressional findings
The Congress finds and declares that—(1) the demand for energy in the United States is increasing and will continue to increase for the foreseeable future;

(2) domestic production of oil and gas has declined in recent years;

(3) the United States has become increasingly dependent upon imports of oil from foreign nations to meet domestic energy demand;

(4) increasing reliance on imported oil is not inevitable, but is rather subject to significant reduction by increasing the development of domestic sources of energy supply;

(5) consumption of natural gas in the United States has greatly exceeded additions to domestic reserves in recent years;

(6) technology is or can be made available which will allow significantly increased domestic production of oil and gas without undue harm or damage to the environment;

(7) the Outer Continental Shelf contains significant quantities of oil and natural gas and is a vital national resource reserve which must be carefully managed so as to realize fair value, to preserve and maintain competition, and to reflect the public interest;

(8) there presently exists a variety of technological, economic, environmental, administrative, and legal problems which tend to retard the development of the oil and natural gas reserves of the Outer Continental Shelf;

(9) environmental and safety regulations relating to activities on the Outer Continental Shelf should be reviewed in light of current technology and information;

(10) the development, processing, and distribution of the oil and gas resources of the Outer Continental Shelf, and the siting of related energy facilities, may cause adverse impacts on various States and local governments;

(11) policies, plans, and programs developed by States and local governments in response to activities on the Outer Continental Shelf cannot anticipate and ameliorate such adverse impacts unless such States, working in close cooperation with affected local governments, are</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) the demand for energy in the United States is increasing and will continue to increase for the foreseeable future;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) domestic production of oil and gas has declined in recent years;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) the United States has become increasingly dependent upon imports of oil from foreign nations to meet domestic energy demand;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) increasing reliance on imported oil is not inevitable, but is rather subject to significant reduction by increasing the development of domestic sources of energy supply;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) consumption of natural gas in the United States has greatly exceeded additions to domestic reserves in recent years;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) technology is or can be made available which will allow significantly increased domestic production of oil and gas without undue harm or damage to the environment;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(7) the Outer Continental Shelf contains significant quantities of oil and natural gas and is a vital national resource reserve which must be carefully managed so as to realize fair value, to preserve and maintain competition, and to reflect the public interest;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(8) there presently exists a variety of technological, economic, environmental, administrative, and legal problems which tend to retard the development of the oil and natural gas reserves of the Outer Continental Shelf;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_9"><akn:num>(9)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(9) environmental and safety regulations relating to activities on the Outer Continental Shelf should be reviewed in light of current technology and information;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1801_10"><akn:num>(10)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(10) the development, processing, and distribution of the oil and gas resources of the Outer Continental Shelf, and the siting of related energy facilities, may cause adverse impacts on various States and local governments;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
