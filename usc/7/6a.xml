Excessive speculation(a) Burden on interstate commerce; trading or position limits(1) In generalExcessive speculation in any commodity under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery made on or subject to the rules of contract markets or derivatives transaction execution facilities, or swaps that perform or affect a significant price discovery function with respect to registered entities causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of such commodity, is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity. For the purpose of diminishing, eliminating, or preventing such burden, the Commission shall, from time to time, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, by rule, regulation, or order, proclaim and fix such limits on the amounts of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any person, including any group or class of traders, under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility, or swaps traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market or a swap execution facility, or swaps not traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market or a swap execution facility that performs a significant price discovery function with respect to a registered entity, as the Commission finds are necessary to diminish, eliminate, or prevent such burden. In determining whether any person has exceeded such limits, the positions held and trading done by any persons directly or indirectly controlled by such person shall be included with the positions held and trading done by such person; and further, such limits upon positions and trading shall apply to positions held by, and trading done by, two or more persons acting pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding, the same as if the positions were held by, or the trading were done by, a single p</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6a_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Burden on interstate commerce; trading or position limits</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Burden on interstate commerce; trading or position limits</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6a_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Prohibition on trading or positions in excess of limits fixed by Commission</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Prohibition on trading or positions in excess of limits fixed by Commission The Commission shall, in such rule, regulation, or order, fix a reasonable time (not to exceed ten days) after the promulgation of the rule, regulation, or order; after which, and until such rule, regulation, or order is suspended, modified, or revoked, it shall be unlawful for any person—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6a_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Applicability to bona fide hedging transactions or positions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Applicability to bona fide hedging transactions or positions</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6a_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Persons subject to regulation; applicability to transactions made by or on behalf of United States</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Persons subject to regulation; applicability to transactions made by or on behalf of United States This section shall apply to a person that is registered as a futures commission merchant, an introducing broker, or a floor broker under authority of this chapter only to the extent that transactions made by such person are made on behalf of or for the account or benefit of such person.
