(b) The Secretary may conduct a referendum at any time, and shall hold a referendum on request of the Board or at least 10 percent of the combined total of the watermelon producers, handlers, and importers eligible to vote in a referendum, to determine if watermelon producers, handlers, and importers favor the termination or suspension of the plan.

Editorial Notes
Amendments1993—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 103–189, § 8(j)(3), struck out at end “Any such referendum shall be conducted at county extension offices.”

Pub. L. 103–189, § 8(j)(1)–(2)(B), in first sentence, substituted “at least 10 percent of the combined total” for “10 per centum or more” and “, handlers, and importers” for “and handlers” in two places, and in second sentence, substituted “, handle, or import” for “or handle” and “50 percent of the combined total” for “50 per centu</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4913_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Whenever the Secretary finds that a plan or any provision thereof obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of this chapter, the Secretary shall terminate or suspend the operation of the plan or provision.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4913_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(b) The Secretary may conduct a referendum at any time, and shall hold a referendum on request of the Board or at least 10 percent of the combined total of the watermelon producers, handlers, and importers eligible to vote in a referendum, to determine if watermelon producers, handlers, and importers favor the termination or suspension of the plan.
