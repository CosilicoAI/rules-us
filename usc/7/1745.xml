Computation of carryover
The quantity of any commodity in the commodity set-aside or transferred from the set-aside to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.) shall be excluded from the computation of “carryover” for the purpose of determining the price support level for such commodity under the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.], and related legislation, but shall be included in the computation of total supplies for purposes of acreage allotments and marketing quotas under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended [7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.], and related legislation. Until such time as the commodity set-aside has been completed, such quantity of the commodity as the Secretary shall determine between the maximum and minimum quantities specified in section 1741 of this title shall be excluded from the computations of “carryover” for the purpose of determining the price support level, but shall be included in the computation of total supplies for purposes of acreage allotments and marketing quotas, for the 1955 crop of the commodity, notwithstanding that the quantity so excluded may not have been acquired by the Corporation and included in the commodity set-aside.
