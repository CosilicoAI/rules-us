Feed grains; price support program(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1441 of this title, beginning with the 1964 crop, price support shall be made available to producers for each crop of corn at such level, not less than 50 per centum or more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor, as the Secretary determines will not result in increasing Commodity Credit Corporation stocks of corn: Provided, That in the case of any crop for which an acreage diversion program is in effect for feed grains, the level of price support for corn of such crop shall be at such level not less than 65 per centum or more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor as the Secretary determines necessary to achieve the acreage reduction goal established by him for the crop.

(b) Beginning with the 1959 crop, price support shall be made available to producers for each crop of oats, rye, barley, and grain sorghums at such level of the parity price therefor as the Secretary of Agriculture determines is fair and reasonable in relation to the level at which price support is made available for corn, taking into consideration the feeding value of such commodity in relation to corn, and the other factors set forth in section 1421(b) of this title.
