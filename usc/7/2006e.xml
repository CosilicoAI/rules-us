Editorial Notes

References in TextThis chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this title”, meaning title III of Pub. L. 87–128, Aug. 8, 1961, 75 Stat. 307, known as the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of title III to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1921 of this title and Tables.
Section 3801(a) of title 16, referred to in text, was subsequently amended, and section 3801(a)(16) no longer defines the term “wetland”. However, such term is defined elsewhere in that section.

Amendments1996—Pub. L. 104–127 inserted at end “This section shall not apply to a loan made or guaranteed under this chapter for a utility line.”
1991—Pub. L. 102–237 inserted a closing parenthesis after “3801(a)(16) of title 16” and substituted “before November 28, 1990” for “prior to the date of enactment of this section”.
