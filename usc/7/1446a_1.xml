Editorial Notes
Codification
Section was enacted as part of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1965, and not as part of the Agricultural Act of 1949 which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of the 1949 Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1421 of this title and Tables.

Amendments1966—Pub. L. 89–808 struck out “foreign distribution,” after “community action,”, thus deleting that part authorizing purchase of dairy products for foreign donation, such authority now being included in the general authority provided for by section 1721 et seq. of this title.
