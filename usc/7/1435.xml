Under such program, producers of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice shall be paid incentive payments to devote a portion of their acreage to such production.

(2) The payments under this subsection shall be made at such rate or rates as the Secretary of Agriculture determines to be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the participation necessary to ensure an adequate supply of commodities for such conversion.

(3) The Secretary may issue any regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.

(4) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
