Sale of land by Secretary of the Interior(a) Authority To Sell.—With the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission, the Secretary of the Interior, for the best interests of the Federal Government, may sell, by deed or instrument, real estate held by the Government in the District of Columbia and under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service which may be no longer needed for public purposes. The land may be sold for cash or on a deferred-payment plan the Secretary approves, at a price not less than the Government paid for it and not less than its present appraised value as determined by the Secretary.

The Secretary shall sell the parcel to the party agreeing to pay the highest price if the price is otherwise satisfactory.

(c) Paying Expenses and Depositing Proceeds.—The Secretary—(1) may pay the reasonable and necessary expenses of the sale of each parcel of land sold; and

(2) shall deposit the net proceeds of each sale in the Treasury to the credit of the Government and the District of Columbia in the proportion that each—(A) paid the appropriations used to acquire the parcels; or

(B) was obligated to pay the appropriations, at the time of acquisition, by reimbursement.
