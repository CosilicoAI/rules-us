The words “the months of” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “Administrator of General Services” are substituted for “Secretary of the Interior” [subsequently changed to [“]Secretary of the Treasury” because of Executive Order No. 4239 (eff. July 1, 1925) and section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933)] because of sections 109(a) and 201(a)(2) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 382, 384), restated as sections 321(b)(1) and 501(d) of the revised title. The word “Government” is substituted for “service” for clarity and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The word “municipal” is omitted as unnecessary.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
