In this section, the text of 36:5302 (last sentence) is omitted as unnecessary and obsolete because it includes authority to change or abolish the departments specified in that provision.
In subsection (a), the words “and the members of” are added for clarity.
In subsection (b), the words “manner of selection” are substituted for “manner of election or appointment” for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “are as provided in the bylaws” are substituted for “the bylaws of the corporation shall prescribe” for consistency in the revised title.</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_151104_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Officers.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) The officers of the corporation are a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, a treasurer, and the members of a board of directors, an executive committee, and any other boards, councils, and committees, and other officers, as provided in the bylaws.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_151104_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Additional Provisions.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Except as provided in this chapter, the manner of selection, term of office, powers, and duties of the officers, boards, councils, and committees are as provided in the bylaws.
