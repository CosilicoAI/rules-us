Editorial Notes
Codification
As enacted by act June 17, 1930, the catchline for this section was “Same—United States officers”, as this section was intended to be read as a continuation of the provisions introduced in section 1619 of this title, and the use of “such” in the first sentence is similarly meant to refer back to section 1619. For text of section 1619 of this title prior to its general amendment by Pub. L. 99–570, see 1986 Amendment note under that section.

Prior ProvisionsProvisions similar to those in this section were contained in act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, § 620, 42 Stat. 988. That section was superseded by section 620 of act June 17, 1930, comprising this section, and repealed by section 651(a)(1) of the 1930 act.
Provisions somewhat similar to those in this section but excepting cases of smuggling were contained in act June 22, 1874, ch. 391, § 7, 18 Stat. 187, prior to repeal by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, § 643, 42 Stat. 989.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
