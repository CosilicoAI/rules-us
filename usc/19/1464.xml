Editorial Notes
Codification
As enacted by act June 17, 1930, the catchline for this section was “Same—penalties in connection with sealed vessels and vehicles”, as this section was intended to be read as a continuation of the provisions introduced in section 1459 of this title. When first enacted, section 1459 of this title related to arrival in the United States from a contiguous country but has since been amended by Pub. L. 99–570 to relate to arrival more generally. The uses of “such” throughout the text are meant to refer back to section 1463 of this title.

Prior ProvisionsProvisions somewhat similar to those in this section, with a further provision for seizure of the vessel, car, or vehicle with its contents, and a provision that nothing therein should prevent sales of cargo prior to arrival, to be delivered per manifest and after due inspection, were contained in R.S. § 3104, which was superseded in part by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, § 464, 42 Stat. 957, and was repealed by section 642 thereof. Section 464 of the 1922 act was superseded by section 464 of act June 17, 1930, comprising this section, and repealed by sec</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
