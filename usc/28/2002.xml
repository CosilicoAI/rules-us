Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 849 (Mar. 3, 1893, ch. 225, § 3, 27 Stat. 751; Apr. 24, 1935, ch. 77, § 3, 49 Stat. 160; June 19, 1935, ch. 276, 49 Stat. 390).
A provision making the section applicable to pending proceedings was deleted as obsolete.
Word “under” was substituted for “ordered pursuant to section 847 of this title by” after “A public sale of realty or interest therein”.
Sections 847 and 848, of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., now sections 2001 and 2004 of this title, relate only to sales under orders or decrees, without any reference to sales under judgments. In 1921 the Supreme Court held, in Yazoo &amp; M. V. R. Co. v. City of Clarksdale, 1921, 42 S.Ct. 27, 257 U.S. 10, 66 L.Ed. 104, that such section 847 did not apply to sales under common law executions. At that time such section 849 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., read as it has been revised above, without any</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
