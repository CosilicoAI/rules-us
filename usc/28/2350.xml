Historical and Revision Notes


DerivationU.S. CodeRevised Statutes andStatutes at Large


 5 U.S.C. 1040.Dec. 29, 1950, ch. 1189, § 10, 64 Stat. 1132.


The words “of the United States” following “Supreme Court” are omitted as unnecessary because the term “Supreme Court” as used in title 28 means the Supreme Court of the United States.
The words “section 2101(f) of this title” are substituted for “section 2101(e) of Title 28” on authority of the Act of May 24, 1949, ch. 139, § 106(b), 63 Stat. 104, which redesignated subsection (e) of section 2101 as subsection (f).

Editorial Notes
