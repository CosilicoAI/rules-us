Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 454 (R.S. § 754).
Words “or by someone acting in his behalf” were added. This follows the actual practice of the courts, as set forth in United States ex rel. Funaro v. Watchorn, C.C. 1908, 164 F. 152; Collins v. Traeger, C.C.A. 1928, 27 F.2d 842, and cases cited.
The third paragraph is new. It was added to conform to existing practice as approved by judicial decisions. See Dorsey v. Gill (App.D.C.) 148 F.2d 857, 865, 866. See also Holiday v. Johnston, 61 S.Ct. 1015, 313 U.S. 342, 85 L.Ed. 1392.
Changes were made in phraseology.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
