Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 109, and section 35 of title 17, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Copyrights (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 320, § 35, 35 Stat. 1084; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 48, 36 Stat. 1100).
Section consolidates section 35 of title 17, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 109 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology.
Subsection (b) is based on section 109 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with the following changes:
Words “civil action” were substituted for “suit,” and words “in law or in equity,” after “shall have jurisdiction” were deleted, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Words in subsection (b) “where the defendant resides” were substituted for “of which the defendant is an inhabitant.” A corresponding change was made in subsection (a). Words “inhabitant” and “resident,” as respects venue, are synonymous. (See reviser’s note under section 1391 of this title.)
Words “whether a person, partnership, or corporation” before “has committed” were omitted as surplusage.
The provisions of section 109 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to process are incorporated in section 1694 of this title.
