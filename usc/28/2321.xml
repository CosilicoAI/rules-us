Historical and Revision Notes
1948 ActBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 44 (Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32, 38 Stat. 220.)
Word “actions” was substituted for “cases,” in view of rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
The exception as to procedure in the infliction of criminal punishment was omitted as unnecessary, as Title 18, U.S.C., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure govern procedure in criminal matters.
Changes were made in phraseology.

1949 ActThis section corrects, in section 2321 of title 28, U.S.C., the reference to certain sections in title 49, U.S.C. The provisions which were formerly set out as section 49 of such title 49, are now set out as section 23 of such title.
