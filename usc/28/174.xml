(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 898; Pub. L. 97–164, title I, § 105(a), Apr. 2, 1982, 96 Stat. 27; Pub. L. 102–572, title IX, § 902(a), Oct. 29, 1992, 106 Stat. 4516.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 243 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 138, 36 Stat. 1136).
This section is based on the first sentence of section 243 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The remainder of said section is incorporated in section 175 of this title.
Words “the seat of government” were substituted for “the city of Washington” to conform to similar language respecting the Supreme Court. (See section 2 of this title.)
Words “to be fixed by rule of court” were added to provide greater flexibility in administering the business of the court. For similar provisions covering the district courts, see section 138 of this title.
Word “term” was substituted for “session” for uniformity.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
