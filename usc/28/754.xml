Receivers of property in different districts
A receiver appointed in any civil action or proceeding involving property, real, personal or mixed, situated in different districts shall, upon giving bond as required by the court, be vested with complete jurisdiction and control of all such property with the right to take possession thereof.
He shall have capacity to sue in any district without ancillary appointment, and may be sued with respect thereto as provided in section 959 of this title.
Such receiver shall, within ten days after the entry of his order of appointment, file copies of the complaint and such order of appointment in the district court for each district in which property is located. The failure to file such copies in any district shall divest the receiver of jurisdiction and control over all such property in that district.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 922.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 117 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 56, 36 Stat. 1102).
Word “action” was substituted for “suit”, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied to land or other property of a fixed character lying in different States within the same circuit. Words “property, real, personal or mixed, situated in different districts”, were inserted to broaden the scope of this section to cover all property in different districts without respect to situs “within different states within same judicial circuit”.
The revised section permits the receiver appointed by any district court to control all property of the defendant in whatever district the property is situated. The provisions of section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for divesting the receiver’s jurisdiction and control of property in other districts upon disapproval by the circuit court of appeals or a judge thereof of the circuit embracing the district of appointment was omitted as unnecessary in view of sections 1292 a</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
