Reviews of State court decisions
A review by the Supreme Court of a judgment or decree of a State court shall be conducted in the same manner and under the same regulations, and shall have the same effect, as if the judgment or decree reviewed had been rendered in a court of the United States.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 962; Pub. L. 100–352, § 5(d)(1), June 27, 1988, 102 Stat. 663.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 871 (R.S., § 1003).
Words “An appeal to” were substituted for “writs of error from”, in view of the abolition of the writ of error.
Changes were made in phraseology.
