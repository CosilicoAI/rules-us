(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 870; Mar. 2, 1955, ch. 9, § 1(a), 69 Stat. 9; Pub. L. 88–426, title IV, § 403(a), Aug. 14, 1964, 78 Stat. 434; Pub. L. 94–82, title II, § 205(b)(1), Aug. 9, 1975, 89 Stat. 422.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 324 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 218, 36 Stat. 1152; Dec. 13, 1926, ch. 6, § 1, 44 Stat. 919; July 31, 1946, ch. 704, § 1, 60 Stat. 716).
The provision “to be paid monthly” was omitted since the time of payment of salaries is a matter of administrative convenience. (See 20 Comp. Gen. 834.)
Minor changes in phraseology were made.
