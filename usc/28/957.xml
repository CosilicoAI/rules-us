(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 926; Pub. L. 95–598, title II, § 234, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2667; Pub. L. 97–164, title I, § 122(b), Apr. 2, 1982, 96 Stat. 36; Pub. L. 98–353, title I, § 109, July 10, 1984, 98 Stat. 342.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 127, 304 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 68, 191, 36 Stat. 1105, 1144).
Section consolidates section 127 with part of 304 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Provisions of section 304 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment, powers, duties, and compensation of the clerk of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and table of fees are incorporated in sections 604, 831, 956 and 1926 of this title.
Appointment and compensation of masters for district courts, see Rule 53(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
The words “commissioner” and “referee” did not appear in section 127 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. They were added to subsection (a) to remove possible ambiguity.
Words “by the court or any judge thereof” in section 304 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as surplusage.
Words “or assistant clerks” and “in any case” were added in subsection (b) to make the section applicable to that officer and consistent with the prohibition in this section against deputies of district court clerks.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
