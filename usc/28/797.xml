(2) Any judge of the Court of Federal Claims receiving an annuity under section 178(c) of this title (pertaining to disability) who, in the estimation of the chief judge, has recovered sufficiently to render judicial service, shall be known and designated as a senior judge and may perform duties as a judge when recalled under subsection (b) of this section.


(b) The chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims may, whenever he deems it advisable, recall any senior judge, with such judge’s consent, to perform such duties as a judge and for such period of time as the chief judge may specify.
