(B) in the event of a court order confirming an arbitration award against the transferor under the collective bargaining agreement, the transferor does not have the financial ability to satisfy the award within 90 days after the order is issued.


(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), “knows or has reason to know” means any of the following:(A) Actual knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture.

When a terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer, or other transferee, is also functioning otherwise as a distributor or as a producer of the motion picture, the public performance exclusion does not affect any obligations imposed on the transferee to the extent that it is engaging in such functions.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4001_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Exclusion for Grants of Security Interests.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Subsection (a) shall not apply to— The exclusion under this subsection shall not affect any rights or remedies under law or contract.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4001_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Deferral Pending Resolution of Bona Fide Dispute.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) A transferee on which obligations are imposed under subsection (a) by virtue of paragraph (1) of that subsection may elect to defer performance of such obligations that are subject to a bona fide dispute between a union and a prior transferor until that dispute is resolved, except that such deferral shall not stay accrual of any union claims due under an applicable collective bargaining agreement.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4001_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Scope of Obligations Determined by Private Agreement.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Nothing in this section shall expand or diminish the rights, obligations, or remedies of any person under the collective bargaining agreements or assumption agreements referred to in this section.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4001_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Failure To Notify.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) If the transferor under subsection (a) fails to notify the transferee under subsection (a) of applicable collective bargaining obligations before the execution of the transfer instrument, and subsection (a) is made applicable to the transferee solely by virtue of subsection (a)(1)(B), the transferor shall be liable to the transferee for any damages suffered by the transferee as a result of the failure to notify.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4001_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Determination of Disputes and Claims.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Any dispute concerning the application of subsections (a) through (f) shall be determined by an action in United States district court, and the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party and may also award a reasonable attorney’s fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4001_h"><akn:num>(h)</akn:num><akn:heading>Study.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(h) The Comptroller General, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, shall conduct a study of the conditions in the motion picture industry that gave rise to this section, and the impact of this section on the motion picture industry.
