Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 193 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, § 112, 36 Stat. 1128; June 15, 1937, ch. 351, 50 Stat. 260; Dec. 28, 1945, ch. 596, 59 Stat. 661).
Words “with the waters thereof,” after the list of counties in each division, were omitted as unnecessary, and in view of the absence of such words in most similar sections relating to other States.
A provision relating to the maintenance of offices by the clerks were omitted as covered by section 751 of this title.
Provisions that the counties in both divisions of the eastern district included all Indian reservations in such counties and that the counties in both divisions of the western district included all Indian reservations in such counties were omitted as surplusage. (See Reviser’s Note under section 114 of this title.)
