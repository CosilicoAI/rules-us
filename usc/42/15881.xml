Hydroelectric production incentives(a) Incentive paymentsFor electric energy generated and sold by a qualified hydroelectric facility during the incentive period, the Secretary shall make, subject to the availability of appropriations, incentive payments to the owner or operator of such facility. The amount of such payment made to any such owner or operator shall be as determined under subsection (e) of this section. Payments under this section may only be made upon receipt by the Secretary of an incentive payment application which establishes that the applicant is eligible to receive such payment and which satisfies such other requirements as the Secretary deems necessary. Such application shall be in such form, and shall be submitted at such time, as the Secretary shall establish.

(B)(i) that is added to an existing dam or conduit; or

(ii)(I) that has a generating capacity of not more than 20 megawatts;

(II) for which the non-Federal entity has received a construction authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, if applicable; and

(III) that is constructed in an area in which there is inadequate electric service, as determined by the Secretary, including by taking into consideration—(aa) access to the electric grid;

(bb) the frequency of electric outages; or

(cc) the affordability of electricity.
