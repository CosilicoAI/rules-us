Suspension, revocation, and termination of licenses(a) Filing of action by Attorney General; automatic suspensionWhenever a licensee fails to comply with any applicable provision of this chapter or any applicable rule, regulation, restriction, or condition issued or imposed by the Administrator under the authority of this chapter, the Attorney General, at the request of the Administrator, shall file an action in the appropriate United States district court to—(1) suspend the license; or

(2) if such failure is knowing and continues for a period of 30 days after the Administrator mails notification of such failure by registered letter to the licensee at his record post office address, revoke such license.


No proceeding under this section is necessary if the license, by its terms, provides for automatic suspension or termination upon the occurrence of a fixed or agreed upon condition, event, or time.

(b) Immediate suspension of construction or operation pending completion of proceedingsIf the Administrator determines that immediate suspension of the construction or operation of an ocean thermal energy conversion facility or plantship or any component thereof is necessary to protect public health and safety or to eliminate imminent and substantial danger to the environment the Administrator may order the licensee to cease or alter such construction or operation pending the completion of a judicial proceeding pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
