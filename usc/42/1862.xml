Functions(a) Initiation and support of studies and programs; scholarships; current register of scientific and engineering personnelThe Foundation is authorized and directed—(1) to initiate and support basic scientific research and programs to strengthen scientific research potential and science education programs at all levels in the mathematical, physical, medical, biological, social, and other sciences, and to initiate and support research fundamental to the engineering process and programs to strengthen engineering research potential and engineering education programs at all levels in the various fields of engineering, by making contracts or other arrangements (including grants, loans, and other forms of assistance) to support such scientific, engineering, and educational activities and to appraise the impact of research upon industrial development and upon the general welfare;

(2) to award, as provided in section 1869 of this title, scholarships and graduate fellowships for study and research in the sciences or in engineering;

(3) to foster the interchange of scientific and engineering information among scientists and engineers in the United States and foreign countries;

(4) to foster and support the development and use of computer and other scientific and engineering methods and technologies, primarily for research and education in the sciences and engineering;

(5) to evaluate the status and needs of the various sciences and fields of engineering as evidenced by programs, projects, and studies undertaken by agencies of the Federal Government, by individuals, and by public and private research groups, employing by grant or contract such consulting services as it may deem necessary for the purpose of such evaluations; and to take into consideration the results of such evaluations in correlating the research and educational programs undertaken or supported by the Foundation with programs, projects, and studies undertaken by agencies of the Federal Gove</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1862_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Initiation and support of studies and programs; scholarships; current register of scientific and engineering personnel</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Initiation and support of studies and programs; scholarships; current register of scientific and engineering personnel The Foundation is authorized and directed—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1862_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Contracts, grants, loans, etc., for scientific and engineering activities; financing of programs</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Contracts, grants, loans, etc., for scientific and engineering activities; financing of programs The Foundation is authorized to initiate and support specific scientific and engineering activities in connection with matters relating to international cooperation, national security, and the effects of scientific and engineering applications upon society by making contracts or other arrangements (including grants, loans, and other forms of assistance) for the conduct of such activities.
