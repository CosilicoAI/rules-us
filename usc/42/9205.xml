Technology application programs(a) Unit, operating, and maintenance costsThe Secretary shall establish a technology application program for wind energy systems to achieve the purposes of this chapter by reduction in unit costs of wind energy systems through mass production and by determination of operating and maintenance costs through broad operational systems experience.


(b) Proposals for Federal assistanceIn achieving the objectives of this section, the Secretary shall solicit and evaluate proposals for Federal assistance pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (c) for investigating, purchasing, and installing such wind energy systems from public or private entities wishing to utilize wind energy systems.


(c) Forms of Federal assistanceIn achieving the objectives of this section, the Secretary is authorized to use various forms of Federal assistance including, but not limited to—(1) contracts and cooperative agreements;

(2) grants;

(3) loans; and

(4) direct Federal procurement.


(d) Quantity production and utilizationIn carrying out his duties under this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to enter into such contracts and cooperative agreements with any public or private entity as may be necessary or appropriate for the production and utilization of large and small wind energy systems in quantities sufficient to achieve the objectives of this section.


(e) Procedure for direct grants for large systems; limitation of amountIn carrying out his duties under this chapter, the Secretary shall, within six months of September 8, 1980, establish procedures to allow any public or private entity wishing to install a large wind energy system to apply for and, upon meeting such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, to receive a direct grant for a portion of the total purchase and installation cost of such wind energy system: Provided, That grants for the portion of such cost in the case of large wind energy systems shall not ex</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9205_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Unit, operating, and maintenance costs</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Unit, operating, and maintenance costs The Secretary shall establish a technology application program for wind energy systems to achieve the purposes of this chapter by reduction in unit costs of wind energy systems through mass production and by determination of operating and maintenance costs through broad operational systems experience.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9205_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Proposals for Federal assistance</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Proposals for Federal assistance In achieving the objectives of this section, the Secretary shall solicit and evaluate proposals for Federal assistance pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (c) for investigating, purchasing, and installing such wind energy systems from public or private entities wishing to utilize wind energy systems.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9205_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Forms of Federal assistance</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Forms of Federal assistance In achieving the objectives of this section, the Secretary is authorized to use various forms of Federal assistance including, but not limited to—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9205_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Quantity production and utilization</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Quantity production and utilization In carrying out his duties under this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to enter into such contracts and cooperative agreements with any public or private entity as may be necessary or appropriate for the production and utilization of large and small wind energy systems in quantities sufficient to achieve the objectives of this section.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9205_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Procedure for direct grants for large systems;
