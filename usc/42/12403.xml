Hydrogen research and development(a) ProgramThe Secretary shall conduct a hydrogen research and development program relating to production, storage, transportation, and use of hydrogen, with the goal of enabling the private sector to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using hydrogen for industrial, residential, transportation, and utility applications.


(b) ResearchIn conducting the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall—(1) give particular attention to developing an understanding and resolution of critical technical issues preventing the introduction of hydrogen into the marketplace;

(2) initiate or accelerate existing research in critical technical issues that will contribute to the development of more economic hydrogen production and use, including, but not limited to, critical technical issues with respect to production (giving priority to those production techniques that use renewable energy resources as their primary source of energy for hydrogen production), liquefaction, transmission, distribution, storage, and use (including use of hydrogen in surface transportation); and

(3) survey private sector hydrogen activities and take steps to ensure that research and development activities under this section do not displace or compete with the privately funded hydrogen research and development activities of United States industry.


(c) Innovative energy technologiesThe Secretary is authorized to evaluate any reasonable new or improved technology, including basic research on highly innovative energy technologies, that could lead or contribute to the development of economic hydrogen production, storage, and utilization.


(d) Renewable energy systems; hybrid systemsThe Secretary is authorized to evaluate any reasonable new or improved technology that could lead or contribute to, or demonstrate the use of, advanced renewable energy systems or hybrid systems for use in isolated communities that currently import diesel fuel as the pri</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_12403_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Program</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Program The Secretary shall conduct a hydrogen research and development program relating to production, storage, transportation, and use of hydrogen, with the goal of enabling the private sector to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using hydrogen for industrial, residential, transportation, and utility applications.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_12403_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Research</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Research In conducting the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_12403_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Innovative energy technologies</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Innovative energy technologies The Secretary is authorized to evaluate any reasonable new or improved technology, including basic research on highly innovative energy technologies, that could lead or contribute to the development of economic hydrogen production, storage, and utilization.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_12403_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Renewable energy systems; hybrid systems</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Renewable energy systems; hybrid systems The Secretary is authorized to evaluate any reasonable new or improved technology that could lead or contribute to, or demonstrate the use of, advanced renewable energy systems or hybrid systems for use in isolated communities that currently import diesel fuel as the primary fuel for electric power production.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_12403_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Information</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Information The Secretary is authorized to arrange for tests and demonstrations and to disseminate to researchers and developers information, data, and other materials necessary to support the research and development activities authorized under this section and other efforts authorized under this chapter, consistent with section 12405 of this title.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_12403_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Federal funding</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Federal funding The Secretary shall carry out the research and development activities authorized under this section only through the funding of research and development proposals submitted by interested persons according to such procedures as the Secretary may require and evaluate on a competitive basis using peer review.
