(3) research on treating WTC-related health conditions, in the case of conditions for which there has been treatment uncertainty.


The Administrator may provide such support through continuation and expansion of research that was initiated before January 2, 2011, and through the World Trade Center Health Registry (referred to in section 300mm–52 of this title), through a Clinical Center of Excellence, or through a Data Center.

(2) in sampled populations outside the New York City disaster area in Manhattan as far north as 14th Street and in Brooklyn, along with control populations, to identify potential for long-term adverse health effects in less exposed populations.
