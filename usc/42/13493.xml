(b) First-of-a-kind engineering(1) Establishment of programThe Secretary shall conduct a program of Federal financial and technical assistance for the first-of-a-kind engineering design of standardized commercial nuclear powerplants which are included, as of October 24, 1992, in the Department of Energy’s program for certification of advanced light water reactor designs.


(2) Selection criteriaIn order to be eligible for assistance under this subsection, an entity shall certify to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—(A) the entity, or its members, are bona fide entities engaged in the design, engineering, manufacture, construction, or operation of nuclear reactors;

(B) the entity, or its members, have the financial resources necessary for, and fully intend to pursue the design, engineering, manufacture, construction, and operation in the United States of nuclear power plants 11 So in original. Probably should be “powerplants”. through completion of construction and into operation;

(C) the design proposed is scheduled for certification by the Commission under the Department of Energy’s program for certification of light water reactor designs; and

(D) at least 50 percent of the funding for the project shall be obtained from non-Federal sources, and a substantial portion of that non-Federal funding shall be obtained from utilities or entities whose primary purpose is the production of electrical power for public </akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_13493_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Certification of designs</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Certification of designs In order to achieve the goal of certification of completed standardized designs by the Commission by 1996 as set forth in section 13492(b) of this title, the Secretary shall conduct a 5-year program of technical and financial assistance to encourage the development and submission for certification of advanced light water reactor designs which, in the judgment of the Secretary, can be certified by the Commission by no later than the end of fiscal year 1996.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_13493_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>First-of-a-kind engineering</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) First-of-a-kind engineering</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
