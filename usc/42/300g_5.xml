Exemptions(a) Requisite findingsA State which has primary enforcement responsibility may exempt any public water system within the State’s jurisdiction from any requirement respecting a maximum contaminant level or any treatment technique requirement, or from both, of an applicable national primary drinking water regulation upon a finding that—(1) due to compelling factors (which may include economic factors, including qualification of the public water system as a system serving a disadvantaged community pursuant to section 300j–12(d) of this title), the public water system is unable to comply with such contaminant level or treatment technique requirement, or to implement measures to develop an alternative source of water supply,

(2) the public water system was in operation on the effective date of such contaminant level or treatment technique requirement, or, for a system that was not in operation by that date, only if no reasonable alternative source of drinking water is available to such new system,

(3) the granting of the exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk to health; 11 So in original. The semicolon probably should be a comma. and

(4) management or restructuring changes (or both) cannot reasonably be made that will result in compliance with this subchapter or, if compliance cannot be achieved, improve the quality of the drinking water.


(b) Compliance schedule and implementation of control measures; notice and hearing; dates for compliance with schedule; compliance, enforcement; approval or revision of schedules and revocation of exemptions(1) If a State grants a public water system an exemption under subsection (a), the State shall prescribe, at the time the exemption is granted, a schedule for—(A) compliance (including increments of progress or measures to develop an alternative source of water supply) by the public water system with each contaminant level requirement or treatment technique requirement with respect to which the exe</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300g_5_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Requisite findings</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Requisite findings A State which has primary enforcement responsibility may exempt any public water system within the State’s jurisdiction from any requirement respecting a maximum contaminant level or any treatment technique requirement, or from both, of an applicable national primary drinking water regulation upon a finding that—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300g_5_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Compliance schedule and implementation of control measures; notice and hearing; dates for compliance with schedule; compliance, enforcement; approval or revision of schedules and revocation of exemptions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Compliance schedule and implementation of control measures; notice and hearing; dates for compliance with schedule; compliance, enforcement; approval or revision of schedules and revocation of exemptions</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300g_5_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Notice to Administrator; reasons for exemption</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Notice to Administrator; reasons for exemption Each State which grants an exemption under subsection (a) shall promptly notify the Administrator of the granting of such exemption.
