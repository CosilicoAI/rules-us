Purpose of the Institute(a) In generalThe general purpose of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (in this section referred to as the “Institute”) is the conduct and support of research, training, the dissemination of health information, and other programs with respect to biomedical imaging, biomedical engineering, and associated technologies and modalities with biomedical applications (in this section referred to as “biomedical imaging and bioengineering”).


(b) National Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Program(1) The Director of the Institute, with the advice of the Institute’s advisory council, shall establish a National Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Program (in this section referred to as the “Program”).

(2) Activities under the Program shall include the following with respect to biomedical imaging and bioengineering:(A) Research into the development of new techniques and devices.

(B) Related research in physics, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and other disciplines.

(C) Technology assessments and outcomes studies to evaluate the effectiveness of biologics, materials, processes, devices, procedures, and informatics.

(D) Research in screening for diseases and disorders.

(E) The advancement of existing imaging and bioengineering modalities, including imaging, biomaterials, and informatics.

(F) The development of target-specific agents to enhance images and to identify and delineate disease.

(G) The development of advanced engineering and imaging technologies and techniques for research from the molecular and genetic to the whole organ and body levels.

(H) The development of new techniques and devices for more effective interventional procedures (such as image-guided interventions).


(3)(A) With respect to the Program, the Director of the Institute shall prepare and transmit to the Secretary and the Director of NIH a plan to initiate, expand, intensify, and coordinate activities of the Institute </akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_285r_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>In general</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) In general The general purpose of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (in this section referred to as the “Institute”) is the conduct and support of research, training, the dissemination of health information, and other programs with respect to biomedical imaging, biomedical engineering, and associated technologies and modalities with biomedical applications (in this section referred to as “biomedical imaging and bioengineering”).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_285r_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>National Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Program</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) National Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Program</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_285r_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Membership</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Membership The establishment under section 284a of this title of an advisory council for the Institute is subject to the following:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
