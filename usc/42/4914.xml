Development of low-noise-emission products(a) DefinitionsFor the purpose of this section:(1) The term “Committee” means the Low-Noise-Emission Product Advisory Committee.

(2) The term “Federal Government” includes the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the Government of the United States, and the government of the District of Columbia.

(3) The term “low-noise-emission product” means any product which emits noise in amounts significantly below the levels specified in noise emission standards under regulations applicable under section 4905 of this title at the time of procurement to that type of product.

(4) The term “retail price” means (A) the maximum statutory price applicable to any type of product; or (B) in any case where there is no applicable maximum statutory price, the most recent procurement price paid for any type of product.


(b) Certification of products; Low-Noise-Emission Product Advisory Committee(1) The Administrator shall determine which products qualify as low-noise-emission products in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(2) The Administrator shall certify any product—(A) for which a certification application has been filed in accordance with paragraph (5)(A) of this subsection;

(B) which is a low-noise-emission product as determined by the Administrator; and

(C) which he determines is suitable for use as a substitute for a type of product at that time in use by agencies of the Federal Government.


(3) The Administrator may establish a Low-Noise-Emission Product Advisory Committee to assist him in determining which products qualify as low-noise-emission products for purposes of this section. The Committee shall include the Administrator or his designee, a representative of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and representatives of such other Federal agencies and private individuals as the Administrator may deem necessary from time to time.

In making purchasing selections between competing eligible certified low-noise-emission products, the procuring agency shall give priority to any class or model which does not require extensive periodic maintenance to retain its low-noise-emission qualities or which does not involve operating costs significantly in excess of those products for which it is a certified substitute.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4914_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Waiver of statutory price limitations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Waiver of statutory price limitations For the purpose of procuring certified low-noise-emission products any statutory price limitations shall be waived.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4914_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Tests of noise emissions from products purchased by Federal Government</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Tests of noise emissions from products purchased by Federal Government The Administrator shall, from time to time as he deems appropriate, test the emissions of noise from certified low-noise-emission products purchased by the Federal Government. If at any time he finds that the noise-emission levels exceed the levels on which certification under this section was based, the Administrator shall give the supplier of such product written notice of this finding, issue public notice of it, and give the supplier an opportunity to make necessary repairs, adjustments, or replacements. If no such repairs, adjustments, or replacements are made within a period to be set by the Administrator, he may order the supplier to show cause why the product involved should be eligible for recertification.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4914_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Authorization of appropriations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Authorization of appropriations There are authorized to be appropriated for paying additional amounts for products pursuant to, and for carrying out the provisions of, this section, $1,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, and $2,000,000 for each of the two succeeding fiscal years, $2,200,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, $550,000 for the transition period of July 1, 1976, through September 30, 1976, and $2,420,000 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1977.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4914_h"><akn:num>(h)</akn:num><akn:heading>Promulgation of procedures</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(h) Promulgation of procedures The Administrator shall promulgate the procedures required to implement this section within one hundred and eighty days after October 27, 1972.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
