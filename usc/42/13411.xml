Enhanced oil recovery(a) Program directionThe Secretary shall conduct a 5-year program, in accordance with sections 13541 and 13542 of this title, on technologies to increase the recoverability of domestic oil resources to—(1) improve reservoir characterization;

(2) improve analysis and field verification;

(3) field test and demonstrate enhanced oil recovery processes, including advanced processes, in reservoirs the Secretary considers to be of high priority, ranked primarily on the basis of oil recovery potential and risk of abandonment;

(4) transfer proven recovery technologies to producers and operators of wells, including stripper wells, that would otherwise be likely to be abandoned in the near term due to declining production;

(5) improve enhanced oil recovery process technology for more economic and efficient oil production;

(6) identify and develop new recovery technologies;

(7) study reservoir properties and how they affect oil recovery from porous media;

(8) improve techniques for meeting environmental requirements;

(9) improve data bases of reservoir and environmental conditions; and

(10) lower lifting costs on stripper wells by utilizing advanced renewable energy technologies such as small wind turbines and others.


(b) Program goals(1) Near-term prioritiesThe near-term priorities of the program include preserving access to high potential reservoirs, identifying available technologies that can extend the lifetime of wells and of stripper well property, and developing environmental field operations for waste disposal and injection practices.


(2) Mid-term prioritiesThe mid-term priorities of the program include developing and testing identified but unproven technologies, and transferring those technologies for widespread use.


(3) Long-term prioritiesThe long-term priorities of the program include developing advanced techniques to recover oil not recoverable by other techniques.
