Editorial Notes

References in TextThis subchapter, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original “this subtitle”, and was translated as reading “this title”, meaning title II of Pub. L. 95–266, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 95–266 does not contain subtitles.

Amendments2010—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 111–320, § 301(c)(1), substituted “2010” for “2004” and “2011 through 2015” for “2005 through 2008”.
Subsecs. (b), (c). Pub. L. 111–320, § 301(c)(2), (3), added subsec. (b) and redesignated former subsec. (b) as (c).
2003—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 108–36 amended subsec. (a) generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows: “There are authorized to be appropriated, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1997, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2001 to carry out programs and activities authorized.”
