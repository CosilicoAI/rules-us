Federal enforcement(a) In general(1) Order to comply with SIPWhenever, on the basis of any information available to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that any person has violated or is in violation of any requirement or prohibition of an applicable implementation plan or permit, the Administrator shall notify the person and the State in which the plan applies of such finding. At any time after the expiration of 30 days following the date on which such notice of a violation is issued, the Administrator may, without regard to the period of violation (subject to section 2462 of title 28)—(A) issue an order requiring such person to comply with the requirements or prohibitions of such plan or permit,

(B) issue an administrative penalty order in accordance with subsection (d), or

(C) bring a civil action in accordance with subsection (b).


(2) State failure to enforce SIP or permit programWhenever, on the basis of information available to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that violations of an applicable implementation plan or an approved permit program under subchapter V are so widespread that such violations appear to result from a failure of the State in which the plan or permit program applies to enforce the plan or permit program effectively, the Administrator shall so notify the State. In the case of a permit program, the notice shall be made in accordance with subchapter V. If the Administrator finds such failure extends beyond the 30th day after such notice (90 days in the case of such permit program), the Administrator shall give public notice of such finding. During the period beginning with such public notice and ending when such State satisfies the Administrator that it will enforce such plan or permit program (hereafter referred to in this section as “period of federally assumed enforcement”), the Administrator may enforce any requirement or prohibition of such plan or permit program with respect to any person by—(A) issuing an or</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7413_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>In general</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) In general Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the United States from commencing a criminal action under subsection (c) at any time for any such violation.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7413_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Civil judicial enforcement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Civil judicial enforcement The Administrator shall, as appropriate, in the case of any person that is the owner or operator of an affected source, a major emitting facility, or a major stationary source, and may, in the case of any other person, commence a civil action for a permanent or temporary injunction, or to assess and recover a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day for each violation, or both, in any of the following instances: Any action under this subsection may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, or is occurring, or in which the defendant resides, or where the defendant’s principal place of business is located, and such court shall have jurisdiction to restrain such violation, to require compliance, to assess such civil penalty, to collect any fees owed the United States under this chapter (other than subchapter II) and any noncompliance assessment and nonpayment penalty owed </akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7413_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Criminal penalties</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Criminal penalties</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7413_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Administrative assessment of civil penalties</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Administrative assessment of civil penalties</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7413_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Penalty assessment criteria</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Penalty assessment criteria</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7413_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Awards</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Awards The Administrator may pay an award, not to exceed $10,000, to any person who furnishes information or services which lead to a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative civil penalty for any violation of this subchapter or subchapter III, IV–A, V, or VI of this chapter enforced under this section.
