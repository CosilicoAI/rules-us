(2) the term “blood fractions” means those constituents of plasma which are used for therapy and which are obtained by licensed fractionation processes presently used in manufacturing which result in licensed products such as normal serum albumin, plasma, protein fraction, prothrombin complex, fibrinogen, AHF concentrate, immune serum globulin, and hyperimmune globulins.


(b) Grants for alleviation of insufficient supplies of blood fractionsIn the event the Secretary finds that there is an insufficient supply of blood fractions available to meet the needs for treatment of persons suffering from hemophilia, and that public and other nonprofit private centers already engaged in the production of blood fractions could alleviate such insufficiency with assistance under this subsection, he may make grants not to exceed $500,000 to such centers for the purposes of alleviating the insufficiency.
