Interagency working group on research regulation(a) Short titleThis section may be cited as the “Research and Development Efficiency Act”.


(b) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) Scientific and technological advancement have been the largest drivers of economic growth in the last 50 years, with the Federal Government being the largest investor in basic research.

(2) Substantial and increasing administrative burdens and costs in Federal research administration, particularly in the higher education sector where most federally funded research is performed, are eroding funds available to carry out basic scientific research.

(3) Federally funded grants are increasingly competitive, with the Foundation funding only approximately 1 in every 5 grant proposals.

(4) Progress has been made over the last decade in streamlining the pre-award grant application process through the Federal Government’s Grants.gov website.

(5) Post-award administrative costs have increased as Federal research agencies have continued to impose agency-unique compliance and reporting requirements on researchers and research institutions.

(6) Researchers spend as much as 42 percent of their time complying with Federal regulations, including administrative tasks such as applying for grants or meeting reporting requirements.


(c) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1) administrative burdens faced by researchers may be reducing the return on investment of federally funded research and development; and

(2) it is a matter of critical importance to United States competitiveness that administrative costs of federally funded research be streamlined so that a higher proportion of federal funding is applied to direct research activities.


(d) EstablishmentThe Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall establish an interagency working group (referred to in this section as the “Working Group”</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6604_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Short title</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Short title This section may be cited as the “Research and Development Efficiency Act”.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6604_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Findings</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Findings Congress makes the following findings:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6604_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Sense of Congress</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Sense of Congress It is the sense of Congress that—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6604_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Establishment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Establishment The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall establish an interagency working group (referred to in this section as the “Working Group”) for the purpose of reducing administrative burdens on federally funded researchers while protecting the public interest through the transparency of and accountability for federally funded activities.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6604_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Responsibilities</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Responsibilities</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6604_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Consultation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Consultation In carrying out its responsibilities under subsection (e)(1), the Working Group shall consult with academic researchers outside the Federal Government, including—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6604_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Reports</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Reports Not later than 1 year after January 6, 2017, and annually thereafter for 3 years, the Working Group shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on its responsibilities under this section, including a discussion of the considerations described in paragraphs (2)(B), (3)(B), and (5)(B) of subsection (e) and recommendations made under subsection (e)(1).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
