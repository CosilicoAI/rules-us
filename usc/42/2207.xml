Claim settlements; reports to Congress
The Commission, acting on behalf of the United States, is authorized to consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, settle, and pay, any claim for money damage of $5,000 or less against the United States for bodily injury, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property resulting from any detonation, explosion, or radiation produced in the conduct of any program undertaken by the Commission involving the detonation of an explosive device, where such claim is presented to the Commission in writing within one year after the accident or incident out of which the claim arises: Provided, however, That the damage to or loss of property, or bodily injury or death, shall not have been caused in whole or in part by any negligence or wrongful act on the part of the claimant, his agents, or employees. Any such settlement under the authority of this section shall be final and conclusive for all purposes, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. If the Commission considers that a claim in excess of $5,000 is meritorious and would otherwise be covered by this section, the Commission may report the facts and circumstances thereof to the Congress for its consideration.
