Allotment to States(a) In general(1) From the sums appropriated under subsections (a) through (d) of section 3023 of this title for each fiscal year, each State shall be allotted an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of older individuals in such State bears to the population of older individuals in all States.

(2) In determining the amounts allotted to States from the sums appropriated under section 3023 of this title for a fiscal year, the Assistant Secretary shall first determine the amount allotted to each State under paragraph (1) and then proportionately adjust such amounts, if necessary, to meet the requirements of paragraph (3).

(3)(A) No State shall be allotted less than ½ of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made.

(B) Guam and the United States Virgin Islands shall each be allotted not less than ¼ of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made.

(C) American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be allotted not less than 1⁄16 of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made. For the purposes of the exception contained in subparagraph (A) only, the term “State” does not include Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

(II) the term “covered fiscal year” means any of fiscal years 2020 through 2029.


(ii) If the sum appropriated under section 3023(a) or 3023(b)(1) of this title for a particular covered fiscal year is less than or equal to the sum appropriated under section 3023(a) or 3023(b)(1) of this title, respectively, for fiscal year 2019, amounts shall be allotted to States fro</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3024_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>In general</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) In general</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3024_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Unused funds</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Unused funds Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that any amount allotted to a State under part B or C, or part E, for a fiscal year under this section will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Assistant Secretary shall make such allotment available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Assistant Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this subchapter, be regarded as part of such State’s allotment (as determined under subsection (a)) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3024_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Withholding of funds; disbursement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Withholding of funds; disbursement If the Assistant Secretary finds that any State has failed to qualify under the State plan requirements of section 3027 of this title or the Assistant Secretary does not approve the funding formula required under section 3025(a)(2)(C) of this title, the Assistant Secretary shall withhold the allotment of funds to such State referred to in subsection (a). The Assistant Secretary shall disburse the funds so withheld directly to any public or private nonprofit institution or organization, agency, or political subdivision of such State submitting an approved plan under section 3027 of this title, which includes an agreement that any such payment shall be matched in the proportion determined under subsection (d)(1)(D) for such State, by funds or in-kind resources from non-Federal sources.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3024_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Costs of administration, ombudsman program, demonstration projects, supportive services, senior centers and nutrition services; payment and determination of non-Federal share</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Costs of administration, ombudsman program, demonstration projects, supportive services, senior centers and nutrition services; payment and determination of non-Federal share</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
