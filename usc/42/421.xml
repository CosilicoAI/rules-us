Disability determinations(a) State agencies(1) In the case of any individual, the determination of whether or not he is under a disability (as defined in section 416(i) or 423(d) of this title) and of the day such disability began, and the determination of the day on which such disability ceases, shall be made by a State agency, notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any State that notifies the Commissioner of Social Security in writing that it wishes to make such disability determinations commencing with such month as the Commissioner of Social Security and the State agree upon, but only if (A) the Commissioner of Social Security has not found, under subsection (b)(1), that the State agency has substantially failed to make disability determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section or rules issued thereunder, and (B) the State has not notified the Commissioner of Social Security, under subsection (b)(2), that it does not wish to make such determinations. If the Commissioner of Social Security once makes the finding described in clause (A) of the preceding sentence, or the State gives the notice referred to in clause (B) of such sentence, the Commissioner of Social Security may thereafter determine whether (and, if so, beginning with which month and under what conditions) the State may again make disability determinations under this paragraph.

(2) The disability determinations described in paragraph (1) made by a State agency shall be made in accordance with the pertinent provisions of this subchapter and the standards and criteria contained in regulations or other written guidelines of the Commissioner of Social Security pertaining to matters such as disability determinations, the class or classes of individuals with respect to which a State may make disability determinations (if it does not wish to do so with respect to all individuals in the State), and the conditions under which it may choose not to make all such determ</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_421_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>State agencies</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) State agencies</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_421_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Determinations by Commissioner</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Determinations by Commissioner</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_421_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Review of determination by Commissioner</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Review of determination by Commissioner</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_421_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Hearings and judicial review</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Hearings and judicial review Any individual dissatisfied with any determination under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (g) shall be entitled to a hearing thereon by the Commissioner of Social Security to the same extent as is provided in section 405(b) of this title with respect to decisions of the Commissioner of Social Security, and to judicial review of the Commissioner’s final decision after such hearing as is provided in section 405(g) of this title.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_421_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>State’s right to cost from Trust Funds</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) State’s right to cost from Trust Funds Each State which is making disability determinations under subsection (a)(1) shall be entitled to receive from the Trust Funds, in advance or by way of reimbursement, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security, the cost to the State of making disability determinations under subsection (a)(1).
