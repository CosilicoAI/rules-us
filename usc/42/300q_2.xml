General provisions(a) Loan guarantees; criteria for approval; recovery of payments by United States; modification, etc., of terms and conditions; incontestability(1) The Secretary may not approve a loan guarantee for a project under this part unless he determines that (A) the terms, conditions, security (if any), and schedule and amount of repayments with respect to the loan are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States and are otherwise reasonable, including a determination that the rate of interest does not exceed such per centum per annum on the principal obligation outstanding as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United States, and (B) the loan would not be available on reasonable terms and conditions without the guarantee under this part.

(2)(A) The United States shall be entitled to recover from the applicant for a loan guarantee under this part the amount of any payment made pursuant to such guarantee, unless the Secretary for good cause waives such right of recovery; and, upon making any such payment, the United States shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the recipient of the payments with respect to which the guarantee was made.

(B) To the extent permitted by subparagraph (C), any terms and conditions applicable to a loan guarantee under this part (including terms and conditions imposed under subparagraph (D)) may be modified by the Secretary to the extent he determines it to be consistent with the financial interest of the United States.

(C) Any loan guarantee made by the Secretary under this part shall be incontestable (i) in the hands of an applicant on whose behalf such guarantee is made unless the applicant engaged in fraud or misrepresentation in securing such guarantee, and (ii) as to any person (or his successor in interest) who makes or contracts to make a loan to such </akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300q_2_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Loan guarantees; criteria for approval; recovery of payments by United States; modification, etc., of terms and conditions; incontestability</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Loan guarantees; criteria for approval; recovery of payments by United States; modification, etc., of terms and conditions; incontestability</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300q_2_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Loans; criteria for approval; terms and conditions; waiver of recovery of payments by United States</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Loans; criteria for approval; terms and conditions; waiver of recovery of payments by United States</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300q_2_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Sale of loans; authority; amount; agreements with purchasers; deposit of proceeds</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Sale of loans; authority; amount; agreements with purchasers; deposit of proceeds</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300q_2_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Loan and loan guarantee fund; establishment; amounts authorized to be appropriated; issuance, purchase, and sale of notes, obligations, etc.; interest rates; public debt transactions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Loan and loan guarantee fund; establishment; amounts authorized to be appropriated; issuance, purchase, and sale of notes, obligations, etc.; interest rates; public debt transactions</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300q_2_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Transfers to and additional capitalization of loan and loan guarantee fund</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Transfers to and additional capitalization of loan and loan guarantee fund</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_300q_2_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Default prevention measures; terms and conditions; implementation of reforms; foreclosures; protection of Federal interest on default</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Default prevention measures; terms and conditions; implementation of reforms; foreclosures; protection of Federal interest on default</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
