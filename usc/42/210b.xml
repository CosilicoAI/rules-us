Professional categories(a) Division of corps; basis of categoriesFor the purpose of establishing eligibility of officers of the Regular Corps for promotions, the Surgeon General shall by regulation divide the corps into professional categories. Each category shall, as far as practicable, be based upon one of the subjects of examination set forth in section 209(a)(1) of this title or upon a subdivision of such subject, and the categories shall be designed to group officers by fields of training in such manner that officers in any one grade in any one category will be available for similar duty in the discharge of the several functions of the Service.


(b) Assignment of officersEach officer of the Regular Corps on active duty shall, on the basis of his training and experience, be assigned by the Surgeon General to one of the categories established by regulations under subsection (a). Except upon amendment of such regulations, no assignment so made shall be changed unless the Surgeon General finds (1) that the original assignment was erroneous, or (2) that the officer is equally well qualified to serve in another category to which he has requested to be transferred, and that such transfer is in the interests of the Service.


(c) Maximum number of officers in each categoryWithin the limits fixed by the Secretary in regulations under section 207(d) of this title for any fiscal year, the Surgeon General shall determine for each category in the Regular Corps the maximum number of officers authorized to be in each of the grades from the warrant officer (W–1) grade to the director grade, inclusive.


(d) Vacancies in grade for purposes of promotionThe excess of the number so fixed for any grade in any category over the number of officers of the Regular Corps on active duty in such grade in such category (including in the case of the director grade, officers holding such grade in accordance with section 207(c) of this title) shall for the purpose of promotions const</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_210b_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Division of corps; basis of categories</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Division of corps; basis of categories For the purpose of establishing eligibility of officers of the Regular Corps for promotions, the Surgeon General shall by regulation divide the corps into professional categories.
