Demonstration of new technology(a) Demonstration programNot later than January 1, 1994, the Secretary, in cooperation with the Administrator of General Services, shall establish a demonstration program to install, in federally owned facilities or federally assisted housing, energy conservation measures for which the Secretary has determined that such installation would accelerate commercial viability. In those cases where technologies are determined to be equivalent, priority shall be given to those technologies that have received or are receiving Federal financial assistance.


(b) Selection criteriaIn addition to the determination under subsection (a), the Secretary shall select, in cooperation with the Administrator of General Services, proposals to be funded under this section on the basis of—(1) cost-effectiveness;

(2) technical feasibility and system reliability in a working environment;

(3) lack of market penetration in the Federal sector;

(4) the potential needs of the proposing Federal agency for the technology, projected over 5 to 10 years;

(5) the potential Federal sector market, projected over 5 to 10 years;

(6) energy efficiency; and

(7) other environmental benefits, including the projected reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and indoor air pollution.


(c) ProposalsFederal agencies may submit to the Secretary, for each fiscal year, proposals for projects to be funded by the Secretary under this section. Each such proposal shall include—(1) a description of the proposed project emphasizing the innovative use of technology in the Federal sector;

(2) a description of the technical reliability and cost-effectiveness data expected to be acquired;

(3) an identification of the potential needs of the Federal agency for the technology;

(4) a commitment to adopt the technology, if the project establishes its technical reliability and life cycle cost-effectiveness, to supply at least 10 percent of the Federal agency’s potential needs identifie</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8258a_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Demonstration program</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Demonstration program Not later than January 1, 1994, the Secretary, in cooperation with the Administrator of General Services, shall establish a demonstration program to install, in federally owned facilities or federally assisted housing, energy conservation measures for which the Secretary has determined that such installation would accelerate commercial viability.
