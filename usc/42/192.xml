Editorial Notes
Codification
In the first sentence of this section, provisions which specified an annual compensation of $5,000 for the chief of the Childrens Bureau have been omitted superseded. Following enactment of the Classification Act of 1923, the compensation was fixed in accordance with that Act. See act Feb. 27, 1925, title IV, 43 Stat. 1050. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Pub. L. 89–554, Sept. 6, 1966, § 8(a), 80 Stat. 632, and reenacted as chapter 51 and subchapter III of chap</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
