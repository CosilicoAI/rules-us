Undergraduate education reform(a) In generalThe Director shall award grants, on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis, to institutions of higher education to expand previously implemented reforms of undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering, or technology education that have been demonstrated to have been successful in increasing the number and quality of students studying toward and completing associate’s or baccalaureate degrees in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology.


(b) Uses of fundsActivities supported by grants under this section may include—(1) expansion of successful reform efforts beyond a single course or group of courses to achieve reform within an entire academic unit;

(2) expansion of successful reform efforts beyond a single academic unit to other science, mathematics, engineering, or technology academic units within an institution;

(3) creation of multidisciplinary courses or programs that formalize collaborations for the purpose of improved student instruction and research in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology;

(4) expansion of undergraduate research opportunities beyond a particular laboratory, course, or academic unit to engage multiple academic units in providing multidisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate students;

(5) expansion of innovative tutoring or mentoring programs proven to enhance student recruitment or persistence to degree completion in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology;

(6) improvement of undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education for nonmajors, including education majors; and

(7) implementation of technology-driven reform efforts, including the installation of technology to facilitate such reform, that directly impact undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering, or technology instruction or research experiences.
