Prohibition on Great Lakes diversions(a) Congressional findings and declarationsThe Congress finds and declares that—(1) the Great Lakes are a most important natural resource to the eight Great Lakes States and two Canadian provinces, providing water supply for domestic and industrial use, clean energy through hydropower production, an efficient transportation mode for moving products into and out of the Great Lakes region, and recreational uses for millions of United States and Canadian citizens;

(2) the Great Lakes need to be carefully managed and protected to meet current and future needs within the Great Lakes basin and Canadian provinces;

(3) any new diversions of Great Lakes water for use outside of the Great Lakes basin will have significant economic and environmental impacts, adversely affecting the use of this resource by the Great Lakes States and Canadian provinces; and

(4) four of the Great Lakes are international waters and are defined as boundary waters in the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 between the United States and Canada, and as such any new diversion of Great Lakes water in the United States would affect the relations of the Government of the United States with the Government of Canada.


(b) Congressional declaration of purpose and policyIt is therefore declared to be the purpose and policy of the Congress in this section—(1) to take immediate action to protect the limited quantity of water available from the Great Lakes system for use by the Great Lakes States and in accordance with the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909;

(2) to encourage the Great Lakes States, in consultation with the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, to develop and implement a mechanism that provides a common conservation standard embodying the principles of water conservation and resource improvement for making decisions concerning the withdrawal and use of water from the Great Lakes Basin;

(3) to prohibit any diversion of Great Lakes water by any State, Federa</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1962d_20_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Congressional findings and declarations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Congressional findings and declarations The Congress finds and declares that—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1962d_20_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Congressional declaration of purpose and policy</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Congressional declaration of purpose and policy It is therefore declared to be the purpose and policy of the Congress in this section—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1962d_20_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>“Great Lakes State” defined</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) “Great Lakes State” defined As used in this section, the term “Great Lakes State” means each of the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Wisconsin.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1962d_20_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Approval by Governors for diversion of water</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Approval by Governors for diversion of water No water shall be diverted or exported from any portion of the Great Lakes within the United States, or from any tributary within the United States of any of the Great Lakes, for use outside the Great Lakes basin unless such diversion or export is approved by the Governor of each of the Great Lake 11 So in original.
