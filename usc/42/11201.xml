Findings
The Congress finds that—(1) best estimates indicate that between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 Americans presently have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias;

(2) estimates of the number of individuals afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are unreliable because current diagnostic procedures lack accuracy and sensitivity and because there is a need for epidemiological data on incidence and prevalence of such disease and dementias;

(3) studies estimate that between one-half and two-thirds of patients in nursing homes meet the clinical and mental status criteria for dementia;

(4) the cost of caring for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias is great, and conservative estimates range between $38,000,000,000 and $42,000,000,000 per year solely for direct costs;

(5) progress in the neurosciences and behavioral sciences has demonstrated the interdependence and mutual reinforcement of basic science, clinical research, and services research for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias;

(6) programs initiated as part of the Decade of the Brain are likely to provide significant progress in understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the causes of, and treatments for, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias;

(7) although substantial progress has been made in recent years in identifying possible leads to the causes of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and more progress can be expected in the near future, there is little likelihood of a breakthrough in the immediate future that would eliminate or substantially reduce—(A) the number of individuals with the disease and dementias; or

(B) the difficulties of caring for the individuals;


(8) the responsibility for care of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias falls primarily on their families, and the care is financially and emotionally devastating;

(9) attempts to reduce the emotional and financial burden of caring for dementia pa</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) best estimates indicate that between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 Americans presently have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) estimates of the number of individuals afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are unreliable because current diagnostic procedures lack accuracy and sensitivity and because there is a need for epidemiological data on incidence and prevalence of such disease and dementias;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) studies estimate that between one-half and two-thirds of patients in nursing homes meet the clinical and mental status criteria for dementia;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) the cost of caring for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias is great, and conservative estimates range between $38,000,000,000 and $42,000,000,000 per year solely for direct costs;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) progress in the neurosciences and behavioral sciences has demonstrated the interdependence and mutual reinforcement of basic science, clinical research, and services research for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) programs initiated as part of the Decade of the Brain are likely to provide significant progress in understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the causes of, and treatments for, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(7) although substantial progress has been made in recent years in identifying possible leads to the causes of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and more progress can be expected in the near future, there is little likelihood of a breakthrough in the immediate future that would eliminate or substantially reduce—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(8) the responsibility for care of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias falls primarily on their families, and the care is financially and emotionally devastating;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_9"><akn:num>(9)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(9) attempts to reduce the emotional and financial burden of caring for dementia patients is impeded by a lack of knowledge about such patients, how to care for such patients, the costs associated with such care, the effectiveness of various modes of care, the quality and type of care necessary at various stages of the disease, and other appropriate services that are needed to provide quality care;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_11201_10"><akn:num>(10)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(10) the results of the little research that has been undertaken concerning dementia has been inadequate or the results have not been widely disseminated;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
