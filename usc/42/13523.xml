Management plan(a) Plan preparationThe Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Board established under section 13522 of this title, shall prepare a management plan for the conduct of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of energy technologies that is consistent with the goals stated in section 13401 of this title.


(b) Contents of planThe management plan under subsection (a) shall provide for—(1) investigation of promising energy and energy efficiency resource technologies that have been identified as potentially significant future contributors to national energy security;

(2) development of energy and energy efficiency resource technologies that have the potential to reduce energy supply vulnerability, and to minimize adverse impacts on the environment, the global climate, and the economy; and

(3) creation of opportunities for export of energy and energy efficiency resource technologies from the United States that can enhance the Nation’s competitiveness.


(c) Energy technology inventory and status reportAs part of the management plan, the Secretary, with the advice of the Advisory Board established under section 13522 of this title, shall develop an inventory and status report of technologies to enhance energy supply and to improve the efficiency of energy end uses. The inventory and status report shall include fossil, renewable, nuclear, and energy conservation technologies which have not yet achieved the status of fully reliable and cost-competitive commercial availability, but which the Secretary projects may become available with additional research, development, and demonstration. The inventory and status report shall provide, for each technology—(1) an assessment of its—(A) degree of technological maturity; and

(B) principal research, development, and demonstration issues, including—(i) the barriers posed by capital, operating, and maintenance costs;

(ii) technical performance; and
