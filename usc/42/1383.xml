Procedure for payment of benefits(a) Time, manner, form, and duration of payments; representative payees; promulgation of regulations(1) Benefits under this subchapter shall be paid at such time or times and (subject to paragraph (10)) in such installments as will best effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, as determined under regulations (and may in any case be paid less frequently than monthly where the amount of the monthly benefit would not exceed $10).

(2)(A)(i) Payments of the benefit of any individual may be made to any such individual or to the eligible spouse (if any) of such individual or partly to each.

(ii)(I) Upon a determination by the Commissioner of Social Security that the interest of such individual would be served thereby, such payments shall be made, regardless of the legal competency or incompetency of the individual or eligible spouse, to another individual, or an organization, with respect to whom the requirements of subparagraph (B) have been met (in this paragraph referred to as such individual’s “representative payee”) for the use and benefit of the individual or eligible spouse.

(II) In the case of an individual eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability, the payment of such benefits shall be made to a representative payee if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that such payment would serve the interest of the individual because the individual also has an alcoholism or drug addiction condition (as determined by the Commissioner) and the individual is incapable of managing such benefits.


(iii) If the Commissioner of Social Security or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative payee of an individual or eligible spouse has misused any benefits which have been paid to the representative payee pursuant to clause (ii) or section 405(j)(1) or 1007 of this title, the Commissioner of Social Security shall promptly terminate payment of benefits to the representative pay</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1383_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Time, manner, form, and duration of payments; representative payees; promulgation of regulations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Time, manner, form, and duration of payments; representative payees; promulgation of regulations</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1383_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Overpayments and underpayments; adjustment, recovery, or payment of amounts by Commissioner</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Overpayments and underpayments; adjustment, recovery, or payment of amounts by Commissioner</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1383_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Hearing to determine eligibility or amount of benefits; subsequent application; time within which to request hearing; time for determinations of Commissioner pursuant to hearing; judicial review</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Hearing to determine eligibility or amount of benefits; subsequent application; time within which to request hearing; time for determinations of Commissioner pursuant to hearing; judicial review</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1383_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Procedures applicable; prohibition on assignment of payments; representation of claimants; maximum fees; penalties for violations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Procedures applicable; prohibition on assignment of payments; representation of claimants; maximum fees; penalties for violations</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1383_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Administrative requirements prescribed by Commissioner; criteria; reduction of benefits to individual for noncompliance with requirements; payment to homeless</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Administrative requirements prescribed by Commissioner; criteria; reduction of benefits to individual for noncompliance with requirements; payment to homeless</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1383_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Furnishing of information by Federal agencies</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Furnishing of information by Federal agencies The head of any Federal agency shall provide such information as the Commissioner of Social Security needs for purposes of determining eligibility for or amount of benefits, or verifying other information with respect thereto.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1383_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Reimbursement to States for interim assistance payments</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Reimbursement to States for interim assistance payments</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1383_h"><akn:num>(h)</akn:num><akn:heading>Payment of certain travel expenses</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(h) Payment of certain travel expenses The Commissioner of Social Security shall pay travel expenses, either on an actual cost or commuted basis, to individuals for travel incident to medical examinations requested by the Commissioner of Social Security in connection with disability determinations under this subchapter, and to parties, their representatives, and all reasonably necessary witnesses for travel within the United States (as defined in section 1382c(e) of this title) to attend reconsideration interviews and proceedings before administrative law judges with respect to any determination under this subchapter.
