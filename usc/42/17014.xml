Research and development into integrating electric vehicles onto the electric grid(a) In generalThe Secretary shall establish a research, development, and demonstration program to advance the integration of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, onto the electric grid.


(b) Vehicles-to-grid integration assessment reportNot later than 1 year after December 27, 2020, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report on the results of a study that examines the research, development, and demonstration opportunities, challenges, and standards needed for integrating electric vehicles onto the electric grid.(1) Report requirementsThe report shall include—(A) an evaluation of the use of electric vehicles to maintain the reliability of the electric grid, including—(i) the use of electric vehicles for demand response, load shaping, emergency power, and frequency regulation; and

(ii) the potential for the reuse of spent electric vehicle batteries for stationary grid storage;


(B) the impact of grid integration on electric vehicles, including—(i) the impact of bi-directional electricity flow on battery degradation; and

(ii) the implications of the use of electric vehicles for grid services on original equipment manufacturer warranties;


(C) the impacts to the electric grid of increased penetration of electric vehicles, including—(i) the distribution grid infrastructure needed to support an increase in charging capacity;

(ii) strategies for integrating electric vehicles onto the distribution grid while limiting infrastructure upgrades;

(iii) the changes in electricity demand over a 24-hour cycle due to electric vehicle charging behavior;

(iv) the load increases expected from electrifying the transportation sector;
