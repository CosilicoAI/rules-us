Cost-of-living adjustments in benefits(a) Increase of dollar amountsWhenever benefit amounts under subchapter II are increased by any percentage effective with any month as a result of a determination made under section 415(i) of this title—(1) each of the dollar amounts in effect for such month under subsections (a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), (b)(1), and (b)(2) of section 1382 of this title, and subsection (a)(1)(A) of section 211 of Public Law 93–66, as specified in such subsections or as previously increased under this section, shall be increased by the amount (if any) by which—(A) the amount which would have been in effect for such month under such subsection but for the rounding of such amount pursuant to paragraph (2), exceeds

(B) the amount in effect for such month under such subsection; and


(2) the amount obtained under paragraph (1) with respect to each subsection shall be further increased by the same percentage by which benefit amounts under subchapter II are increased for such month, or, if greater (in any case where the increase under subchapter II was determined on the basis of the wage increase percentage rather than the CPI increase percentage), the percentage by which benefit amounts under subchapter II would be increased for such month if the increase had been determined on the basis of the CPI increase percentage, (and rounded, when not a multiple of $12, to the next lower multiple of $12), effective with respect to benefits for months after such month.
