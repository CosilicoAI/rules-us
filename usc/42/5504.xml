Development and demonstration of combined solar heating and cooling systems for use in residential dwellings(a) Functions of Administrator and SecretaryThe Administrator and the Secretary shall promptly initiate and carry out a program, as provided in this section, for the development and demonstration of combined solar heating and cooling systems (including collectors, controls, and thermal storage) for use in residential dwellings.


(b) Time for determination, prescription and publishing of interim performance criteria; selection of designs for suitable dwellings(1) As soon as possible after September 3, 1974, the Secretary, utilizing the services of the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy, shall determine, prescribe, and publish—(A) interim performance criteria for combined solar heating and cooling components and systems to be used in residential dwellings, and

(B) interim performance criteria (relating to suitability for solar heating and cooling) for such dwellings themselves,


taking into account in each instance climatic variations existing between different geographic areas.

(2) As soon as possible after the publication of the performance criteria prescribed under paragraph (1) (and if possible before the completion of the research and development provided for in subsection (c)), the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Administrator, will select on the basis of open competition a number of designs for various types of residential dwellings suitable for and adapted to the installation of combined solar heating and cooling systems meeting the performance criteria prescribed under paragraph (1)(A).
