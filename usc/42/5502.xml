Definitions
For purposes of this subchapter—(1) the term “solar heating”, with respect to any building, means the use of solar energy to meet such portion of the total heating needs of such building (including hot water), or such portion of the needs of such building for hot water (where its remaining heating needs are met by other methods), as may be required under performance criteria prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development utilizing the services of the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;

(2) the terms “solar heating and cooling” and “combined solar heating and cooling”, with respect to any building, mean the use of solar energy to provide both such portion of the total heating needs of such building (including hot water) and such portion of the total cooling needs of such building, or such portion of the needs of such building for hot water (where its remaining heating needs are met by other methods) and such portion of the total cooling needs of a building, as may be required under performance criteria prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development utilizing the services of the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and such term includes cooling by means of nocturnal heat radiation, by evaporation, or by other methods of meeting peakload energy requirements at nonpeakload times;

(3) the term “residential dwellings” includes previously occupied and new single family and multifamily dwellings, mobile homes, and publicly assisted housing owned by a private sponsor or a State or local housing authority not covered by section 5515 of this title;

(4) the term “Administrator” means the Administrator of the National Aeronaut</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5502_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) the term “solar heating”, with respect to any building, means the use of solar energy to meet such portion of the total heating needs of such building (including hot water), or such portion of the needs of such building for hot water (where its remaining heating needs are met by other methods), as may be required under performance criteria prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development utilizing the services of the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5502_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) the terms “solar heating and cooling” and “combined solar heating and cooling”, with respect to any building, mean the use of solar energy to provide both such portion of the total heating needs of such building (including hot water) and such portion of the total cooling needs of such building, or such portion of the needs of such building for hot water (where its remaining heating needs are met by other methods) and such portion of the total cooling needs of a building, as may be required under performance criteria prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development utilizing the services of the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and such term includes cooling by means of nocturnal heat radiation, by evaporation, or by other methods of meeting peakload energy requirements at nonpeakload times;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5502_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) the term “residential dwellings” includes previously occupied and new single family and multifamily dwellings, mobile homes, and publicly assisted housing owned by a private sponsor or a State or local housing authority not covered by section 5515 of this title;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5502_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) the term “Administrator” means the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5502_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) the term “Secretary” means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5502_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) Omitted.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
