Working group on inclusion in STEM fields(a) EstablishmentThe Office of Science and Technology Policy, in collaboration with Federal departments and agencies, shall establish an interagency working group to compile and summarize available research and best practices on how to promote diversity and inclusions in STEM fields and examine whether barriers exist to promoting diversity and inclusion within Federal agencies employing scientists and engineers.


(b) ResponsibilitiesThe working group shall be responsible for reviewing and assessing research, best practices, and policies across Federal science agencies related to the inclusion of individuals identified in sections 1885a and 1885b of this title in the Federal STEM workforce, including available research and best practices on how to promote diversity and inclusion in STEM fields, including—(1) policies providing flexibility for scientists and engineers that are also caregivers, particularly on the timing of research grants;

(2) policies to address the proper handling of claims of sexual harassment;

(3) policies to minimize the effects of implicit bias and other systemic factors in hiring, promotion, evaluation and the workplace in general; and

(4) other evidence-based strategies that the working group considers effective for promoting diversity and inclusion in the STEM fields.


(c) Stakeholder inputIn carrying out the responsibilities under section (b), the working group shall solicit and consider input and recommendations from non-Federal stakeholders, including—(1) the Council of Advisors on Science and Technology;

(2) federally funded and non-federally funded researchers, institutions of higher education, scientific disciplinary societies, and associations;

(3) nonprofit research institutions;

(4) industry, including small businesses;

(5) federally funded research and development centers;

(6) non-governmental organizations; and
