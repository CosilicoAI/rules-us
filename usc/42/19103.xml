Activities
Subject to the availability of appropriated funds, the Director shall achieve the purposes described in section 19102 of this title by making awards through the Directorate that—(1) support transformational advances in use-inspired and translational research and technology development, including through diverse funding mechanisms and models at different scales, to include convergence accelerators and projects designed to achieve specific technology metrics or objectives;

(2) encourage the translation of research into innovations, processes, and products, including by—(A) engaging researchers on topics relevant to United States societal, national, and geostrategic challenges, including by educating researchers on engaging with end users and the public;

(B) advancing novel approaches and reducing barriers to technology transfer, including through intellectual property frameworks between academia and industry, nonprofit entities, venture capital communities, and approaches to technology transfer for applications with public benefit that may not rely on traditional commercialization tools; and

(C) establishing partnerships that connect researchers and research products to businesses, accelerators, and incubators that enable research uptake, prototype development and scaling, entrepreneurial education, and the formation and growth of new companies;


(3) develop mutually-beneficial research and technology development partnerships and collaborations among institutions of higher education, including historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, minority-serving institutions, emerging research institutions, EPSCoR institutions, and nonprofit organizations, labor organizations, businesses and other for-profit entities, Federal or State agencies, local or Tribal governments, civil society organizations, other Foundation directorates, national labs, field stations and marine laboratories, and, as appropriate, internationa</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_19103_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) support transformational advances in use-inspired and translational research and technology development, including through diverse funding mechanisms and models at different scales, to include convergence accelerators and projects designed to achieve specific technology metrics or objectives;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_19103_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) encourage the translation of research into innovations, processes, and products, including by—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_19103_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) develop mutually-beneficial research and technology development partnerships and collaborations among institutions of higher education, including historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, minority-serving institutions, emerging research institutions, EPSCoR institutions, and nonprofit organizations, labor organizations, businesses and other for-profit entities, Federal or State agencies, local or Tribal governments, civil society organizations, other Foundation directorates, national labs, field stations and marine laboratories, and, as appropriate, international entities and binational research and development foundations and funds, excluding foreign entities of concern;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_19103_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) partner with other directorates and offices of the Foundation for specific projects or research areas including—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_19103_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) build capacity and infrastructure for use-inspired and translational research at institutions of higher education across the United States, including by making awards to support administrative activities that advance development, operation, integration, deployment, and sharing of innovation;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_19103_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) support the education, mentoring, and training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, to both advance use-inspired and translational research and to address workforce challenges, through scholarships, fellowships, and traineeships; and</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_19103_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(7) identify social, behavioral, and economic drivers and consequences of technological innovations that could enable advances in the challenges and key technology focus areas under section 19107 of this title.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
