Definitions
As used in sections 7275 to 7276c of this title:(1) The term “Administrator” means the Administrator of the Western Area Power Administration.

(2) The term “integrated resource planning” means a planning process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including new generating capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating and cooling applications, and renewable energy resources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its electric customers at the lowest system cost. The process shall take into account necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability, and other factors of risk; shall take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved through energy conservation and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; and shall treat demand and supply resources on a consistent and integrated basis.

(3) The term “least cost option” means an option for providing reliable electric services to electric customers which will, to the extent practicable, minimize life-cycle system costs, including adverse environmental effects, of providing such service. To the extent practicable, energy efficiency and renewable resources may be given priority in any least-cost option.

(4) The term “long-term firm power service contract” means any contract for the sale by Western Area Power Administration of firm capacity, with or without energy, which is to be delivered over a period of more than one year.

(5) The terms “customer” or “customers” means any entity or entities purchasing firm capacity with or without energy, from the Western Area Power Administration under a long-term firm power service contract. Such terms include parent-type entities and their distribution or user members.

(6) For any customer, the term “applicable integrated resource plan” means the integrated resource plan approve</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7275_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) The term “Administrator” means the Administrator of the Western Area Power Administration.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7275_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) The term “integrated resource planning” means a planning process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including new generating capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating and cooling applications, and renewable energy resources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its electric customers at the lowest system cost.
