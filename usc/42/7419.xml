Primary nonferrous smelter orders(a) Issuance; hearing; enforcement orders; statement of grounds for application; findings(1) Upon application by the owner or operator of a primary nonferrous smelter, a primary nonferrous smelter order under subsection (b) may be issued—(A) by the Administrator, after thirty days’ notice to the State, or

(B) by the State in which such source is located, but no such order issued by the State shall take effect until the Administrator determines that such order has been issued in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.


Not later than ninety days after submission by the State to the Administrator of notice of the issuance of a primary nonferrous smelter order under this section, the Administrator shall determine whether or not such order has been issued by the State in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. If the Administrator determines that such order has not been issued in accordance with such requirements, he shall conduct a hearing respecting the reasonably available control technology for primary nonferrous smelters.

(2)(A) An order issued under this section to a primary nonferrous smelter shall be referred to as a “primary nonferrous smelter order”. No primary nonferrous smelter may receive both an enforcement order under section 7413(d) 11 See References in Text note below. of this title and a primary nonferrous smelter order under this section.

(B) Before any hearing conducted under this section, in the case of an application made by the owner or operator of a primary nonferrous smelter for a second order under this section, the applicant shall furnish the Administrator (or the State as the case may be) with a statement of the grounds on which such application is based (including all supporting documents and information). The statement of the grounds for the proposed order shall be provided by the Administrator or the State in any case in which such State or Administrator is acting on its own </akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7419_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Issuance; hearing; enforcement orders; statement of grounds for application; findings</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Issuance; hearing; enforcement orders; statement of grounds for application; findings</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7419_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Prerequisites to issuance of orders</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Prerequisites to issuance of orders A primary nonferrous smelter order under this section may be issued to a primary nonferrous smelter if—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7419_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Second orders</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Second orders</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7419_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Interim measures; continuous emission reduction technology</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Interim measures; continuous emission reduction technology</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7419_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Termination of orders</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Termination of orders At any time during which an order under this section applies, the Administrator may enter upon a public hearing respecting the availability of technology.

If the owner or operator of the smelter to which the order is issued demonstrates that prompt termination of such order would result in undue hardship, the termination shall become effective at the earliest practicable date on which such undue hardship would not result, but in no event later than the date required under subsection (c).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7419_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Violation of requirements</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Violation of requirements If the Administrator determines that a smelter to which an order is issued under this section is in violation of any requirement of subsection (c) or (d), he shall—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
