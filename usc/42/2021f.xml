Emergency access(a) In generalThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission may grant emergency access to any regional disposal facility or non-Federal disposal facility within a State that is not a member of a compact for specific low-level radioactive waste, if necessary to eliminate an immediate and serious threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and security. The procedure for granting emergency access shall be as provided in this section.


(b) Request for emergency accessAny generator of low-level radioactive waste, or any Governor (or, for any State without a Governor, the chief executive officer of the State) on behalf of any generator or generators located in his or her State, may request that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission grant emergency access to a regional disposal facility or a non-Federal disposal facility within a State that is not a member of a compact for specific low-level radioactive waste. Any such request shall contain any information and certifications the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may require.


(c) Determination of Nuclear Regulatory Commission(1) Required determinationNot later than 45 days after receiving a request under subsection (b), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall determine whether—(A) emergency access is necessary because of an immediate and serious threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and security; and

(B) the threat cannot be mitigated by any alternative consistent with the public health and safety, including storage of low-level radioactive waste at the site of generation or in a storage facility obtaining access to a disposal facility by voluntary agreement, purchasing disposal capacity available for assignment pursuant to section 2021e(c) of this title or ceasing activities that generate low-level radioactive waste.

In granting access under this subsection, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall provide the same notification and information required under subsection (c). Absent a determination that no alternative consistent with the public health and safety would mitigate the threat, access granted under this subsection shall expire 45 days after the granting of temporary emergency access under this subsection.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2021f_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Extension of emergency access</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Extension of emergency access The Nuclear Regulatory Commission may grant one extension of emergency access beyond the period provided in subsection (c), if it determines that emergency access continues to be necessary because of an immediate and serious threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and security that cannot be mitigated by any alternative consistent with the public health and safety, and that the generator of low-level radioactive waste granted emergency access and the State in which such low-level radioactive waste was generated have diligently though unsuccessfully acted during the period of the initial grant to eliminate the need for emergency access. Any extension granted under this subsection shall be for the minimum volume and duration the Nuclear Regulatory Commission finds necessary to eliminate the immediate threat to public health and safety or the common defense and security, and shall not in any event exceed 180 days.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2021f_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Reciprocal access</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Reciprocal access Any compact region or State not a member of a compact that provides emergency access to non-Federal disposal facilities within its borders shall be entitled to reciprocal access to any subsequently operating non-Federal disposal facility that serves the State or compact region in which low-level radioactive waste granted emergency access was generated.
