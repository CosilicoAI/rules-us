Financial assistance for Native American projects(a) Authorization for financial assistance to public and nonprofit agencies; consultation with other Federal agencies to avoid duplicationThe Commissioner is authorized to provide financial assistance, on a single year or multiyear basis, to public and nonprofit private agencies, including but not limited to, governing bodies of Indian Tribes on Federal and State reservations, Alaska Native villages and regional corporations established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], and such public and nonprofit private agencies serving Native Hawaiians, and Indian and Alaska Native organizations in urban or rural areas that are not Indian reservations or Alaska Native villages, for projects pertaining to the purposes of this subchapter. The Commissioner is authorized to provide financial assistance to public and nonprofit private agencies serving other Native American Pacific Islanders (including American Samoan Natives) for projects pertaining to the purposes of this Act. In determining the projects to be assisted under this subchapter, the Commissioner shall consult with other Federal agencies for the purpose of eliminating duplication or conflict among similar activities or projects and for the purpose of determining whether the findings resulting from those projects may be incorporated into one or more programs for which those agencies are responsible. Every determination made with respect to a request for financial assistance under this section shall be made without regard to whether the agency making such request serves, or the project to be assisted is for the benefit of, Indians who are not members of a federally recognized Tribe. To the greatest extent practicable, the Commissioner shall ensure that each project to be assisted under this subchapter is consistent with the priorities established by the agency which receives such assistance.
