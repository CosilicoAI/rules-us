Nonattainment plan provisions in general(a) Classifications and attainment dates(1) Classifications(A) On or after the date the Administrator promulgates the designation of an area as a nonattainment area pursuant to section 7407(d) of this title with respect to any national ambient air quality standard (or any revised standard, including a revision of any standard in effect on November 15, 1990), the Administrator may classify the area for the purpose of applying an attainment date pursuant to paragraph (2), and for other purposes. In determining the appropriate classification, if any, for a nonattainment area, the Administrator may consider such factors as the severity of nonattainment in such area and the availability and feasibility of the pollution control measures that the Administrator believes may be necessary to provide for attainment of such standard in such area.

(B) The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing each classification under subparagraph (A), except the Administrator shall provide an opportunity for at least 30 days for written comment. Such classification shall not be subject to the provisions of sections 553 through 557 of title 5 (concerning notice and comment) and shall not be subject to judicial review until the Administrator takes final action under subsection (k) or (l) of section 7410 of this title (concerning action on plan submissions) or section 7509 of this title (concerning sanctions) with respect to any plan submissions required by virtue of such classification.

(C) This paragraph shall not apply with respect to nonattainment areas for which classifications are specifically provided under other provisions of this part.


(2) Attainment dates for nonattainment areas(A) The attainment date for an area designated nonattainment with respect to a national primary ambient air quality standard shall be the date by which attainment can be achieved as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7502_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Classifications and attainment dates</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Classifications and attainment dates</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7502_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Schedule for plan submissions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Schedule for plan submissions At the time the Administrator promulgates the designation of an area as nonattainment with respect to a national ambient air quality standard under section 7407(d) of this title, the Administrator shall establish a schedule according to which the State containing such area shall submit a plan or plan revision (including the plan items) meeting the applicable requirements of subsection (c) and section 7410(a)(2) of this title. Such schedule shall at a minimum, include a date or dates, extending no later than 3 years from the date of the nonattainment designation, for the submission of a plan or plan revision (including the plan items) meeting the applicable requirements of subsection (c) and section 7410(a)(2) of this title.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7502_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Nonattainment plan provisions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Nonattainment plan provisions The plan provisions (including plan items) required to be submitted under this part shall comply with each of the following:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7502_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Plan revisions required in response to finding of plan inadequacy</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Plan revisions required in response to finding of plan inadequacy Any plan revision for a nonattainment area which is required to be submitted in response to a finding by the Administrator pursuant to section 7410(k)(5) of this title (relating to calls for plan revisions) must correct the plan deficiency (or deficiencies) specified by the Administrator and meet all other applicable plan requirements of section 7410 of this title and this part. The Administrator may reasonably adjust the dates otherwise applicable under such requirements to such revision (except for attainment dates that have not yet elapsed), to the extent necessary to achieve a consistent application of such requirements. In order to facilitate submittal by the States of adequate and approvable plans consistent with the applicable requirements of this chapter, the Administrator shall, as appropriate and from time to time, issue written guidelines, interpretations, and information to the States which shall be avail</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7502_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Future modification of standard</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Future modification of standard If the Administrator relaxes a national primary ambient air quality standard after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall, within 12 months after the relaxation, promulgate requirements applicable to all areas which have not attained that standard as of the date of such relaxation. Such requirements shall provide for controls which are not less stringent than the controls applicable to areas designated nonattainment before such relaxation.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
