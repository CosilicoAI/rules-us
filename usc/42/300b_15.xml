Hunter Kelly Research Program(a) Newborn screening activities(1) In generalThe Secretary, in conjunction with the Director of the National Institutes of Health and taking into consideration the recommendations of the Advisory Committee, may continue carrying out, coordinating, and expanding research in newborn screening (to be known as “Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program”) including—(A) identifying, developing, and testing the most promising new screening technologies, in order to improve already existing screening tests, increase the specificity of newborn screening, and expand the number of conditions for which screening tests are available;

(B) experimental treatments and disease management strategies for additional newborn conditions, and other genetic, metabolic, hormonal, or functional conditions that can be detected through newborn screening for which treatment is not yet available;

(C) providing research findings and data for newborn conditions under review by the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children to be added to the recommended uniform screening panel;

(D) conducting pilot studies on conditions recommended by the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children to ensure that screenings are ready for nationwide implementation; and

(E) other activities that would improve newborn screening, as identified by the Director.


(2) Additional newborn conditionFor purposes of this subsection, the term “additional newborn condition” means any condition that is not one of the core conditions recommended by the Advisory Committee and adopted by the Secretary.
