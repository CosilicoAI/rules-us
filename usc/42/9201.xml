Congressional findings and declaration of purpose(a) The Congress finds that—(1) the United States is faced with a finite and diminishing resource base of native fossil fuels and, as a consequence, must develop as quickly as possible a diversified, pluralistic national energy capability and posture;

(2) the current imbalance between supply and demand for fuels and energy in the United States is likely to grow for many years;

(3) it is in the Nation’s interest to provide opportunities for the increased production of electricity from renewable energy sources;

(4) the early wide-spread utilization of wind energy for the generation of electricity and for mechanical power could lead to relief on the demand for existing non-renewable fuel and energy supplies;

(5) the use of large wind energy systems for certain limited applications is already economically feasible;

(6) the use of small wind energy systems for certain applications is already economically feasible, and therefore, the Federal Government should not undertake any financial incentive or financial initiative which may detrimentally affect commercial markets for small wind energy systems;

(7) an aggressive research, development and demonstration program to accelerate widespread utilization of wind energy should solve existing technical problems of converting wind energy into electricity and mechanical energy and, supported by an assured and growing market for wind energy systems during the next decade, should maximize the future contribution of wind energy to the Nation’s future energy production;

(8) it is the proper and appropriate role of the Federal Government to undertake research and development, to participate in demonstration programs for wind energy systems, and to assist private industry, other entities, and the general public in hastening the widespread utilization of such systems;
