Classifications and attainment dates(a) Initial classificationsEvery area designated nonattainment for PM–10 pursuant to section 7407(d) of this title shall be classified at the time of such designation, by operation of law, as a moderate PM–10 nonattainment area (also referred to in this subpart as a “Moderate Area”) at the time of such designation.

The Administrator shall reclassify appropriate areas as Serious by the following dates:(A) For areas designated nonattainment for PM–10 under section 7407(d)(4) of this title, the Administrator shall propose to reclassify appropriate areas by June 30, 1991, and take final action by December 31, 1991.
