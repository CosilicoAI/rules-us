National Advanced Materials Program(a) Program directionThe Secretary shall establish a 5-year National Advanced Materials Program, in accordance with sections 13541 and 13542 of this title. Such program shall foster the commercialization of techniques for processing, synthesizing, fabricating, and manufacturing advanced materials and associated components. At a minimum, the Program shall expedite the private sector deployment of advanced materials for use in high performance energy efficient and renewable energy technologies in the industrial, transportation, and buildings sectors that can foster economic growth and competitiveness. The Program shall include field demonstrations of sufficient scale and number to prove technical and economic feasibility.


(b) Program planWithin 180 days after October 24, 1992, the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate representatives of industry, institutions of higher education, Department of Energy national laboratories, and professional and technical societies, shall prepare and submit to the Congress a 5-year program plan to guide activities under this section. The Secretary shall biennially update and resubmit the program plan to Congress.


(c) Proposals(1) SolicitationWithin 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall solicit proposals for conducting activities consistent with the 5-year program plan. Such proposals may be submitted by one or more parties.


(2) Contents of proposalsProposals submitted under this subsection shall include—(A) an explanation of how the proposal will expedite the commercialization of advanced materials in energy efficiency or renewable energy in the near-term to mid-term;

(B) evidence of consideration of whether the unique capabilities of Department of Energy national laboratories warrants collaboration with such laboratories, and the extent of such collaboration proposed;

(C) a description of the extent to which the proposal includes collaboration with relevant industry</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_13501_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Program direction</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Program direction The Secretary shall establish a 5-year National Advanced Materials Program, in accordance with sections 13541 and 13542 of this title.
