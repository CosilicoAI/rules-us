Probably should be “sections”. 13541 and 13542 of this title, conduct programs for research, development, demonstration, and commercial application on coal-based technologies. Such research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs shall include the programs established under this part, and shall have the goals and objectives of—(1) ensuring a reliable electricity supply;

(2) complying with applicable environmental requirements;

(3) achieving the control of sulfur oxides, oxides of nitrogen, air toxics, solid and liquid wastes, greenhouse gases, or other emissions resulting from coal use or conversion at levels of proficiency greater than or equal to applicable currently available commercial technology;

(4) achieving the cost competitive conversion of coal into energy forms usable in the transportation sector;

(5) demonstrating the conversion of coal to synthetic gaseous, liquid, and solid fuels;

(6) demonstrating, in cooperation with other Federal and State agencies, the use of coal-derived fuels in mobile equipment, with opportunities for industrial cost sharing participation;

(7) ensuring the timely commercial application of cost-effective technologies or energy production processes or systems utilizing coal which achieve—(A) greater efficiency in the conversion of coal to useful energy when compared to currently available commercial technology for the use of coal; and

(B) the control of emissions from the utilization of coal; and


(8) ensuring the availability for commercial use of such technologies by the year 2010.


(b) Demonstration and commercial application programs(1) In selecting either a demonstration project or a commercial application project for financial assistance under this part, the Secretary shall seek to ensure that, relative to otherwise compara</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_13331_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Establishment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Establishment The Secretary shall, in accordance with section 11 So in original.
