Quarter and quarter of coverage(a) DefinitionsFor the purposes of this subchapter—(1) The term “quarter”, and the term “calendar quarter”, mean a period of three calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.

(2)(A) The term “quarter of coverage” means—(i) for calendar years before 1978, and subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), a quarter in which an individual has been paid $50 or more in wages (except wages for agricultural labor paid after 1954) or for which he has been credited (as determined under section 412 of this title) with $100 or more of self-employment income; and

(ii) for calendar years after 1977, and subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), each portion of the total of the wages paid and the self-employment income credited (pursuant to section 412 of this title) to an individual in a calendar year which equals the amount required for a quarter of coverage in that calendar year (as determined under subsection (d)), with such quarter of coverage being assigned to a specific calendar quarter in such calendar year only if necessary in the case of any individual who has attained age 62 or died or is under a disability and the requirements for insured status in subsection (a) or (b) of section 414 of this title, the requirements for entitlement to a computation or recomputation of his primary insurance amount, or the requirements of paragraph (3) of section 416(i) of this title would not otherwise be met.


(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A)—(i) no quarter after the quarter in which an individual dies shall be a quarter of coverage, and no quarter any part of which is included in a period of disability (other than the initial quarter and the last quarter of such period) shall be a quarter of coverage;

(ii) if the wages paid to an individual in any calendar year equal $3,000 in the case of a calendar year before 1951, or $3,600 in the case of a calendar year after 1950 and before 1955,</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_413_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Definitions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Definitions For the purposes of this subchapter—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_413_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Crediting of wages paid in 1937</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Crediting of wages paid in 1937 With respect to wages paid to an individual in the six-month periods commencing either January 1, 1937, or July 1, 1937; (A) if wages of not less than $100 were paid in any such period, one-half of the total amount thereof shall be deemed to have been paid in each of the calendar quarters in such period; and (B) if wages of less than $100 were paid in any such period, the total amount thereof shall be deemed to have been paid in the latter quarter of such period, except that if in any such period, the individual attained age sixty-five, all of the wages paid in such period shall be deemed to have been paid before such age was attained.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_413_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Alternative method for determining quarters of coverage with respect to wages in period from 1937 to 1950</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Alternative method for determining quarters of coverage with respect to wages in period from 1937 to 1950 For purposes of sections 414(a) and 415(d) of this title, an individual shall be deemed to have one quarter of coverage for each $400 of his total wages prior to 1951 (as defined in section 415(d)(1)(C) of this title), except where such individual is not a fully insured individual on the basis of the number of quarters of coverage so derived plus the number of quarters of coverage derived from the wages and self-employment income credited to such individual for periods after 1950.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_413_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Amount required for a quarter of coverage</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Amount required for a quarter of coverage</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
