Home health services(a) Purpose; authorization of grants and loans; considerations; conditions on loans; appropriations(1) For the purpose of encouraging the establishment and initial operation of home health programs to provide home health services in areas in which such services are inadequate or not readily accessible, the Secretary may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, make grants to public and nonprofit private entities and loans to proprietary entities to meet the initial costs of establishing and operating such home health programs. Such grants and loans may include funds to provide training for paraprofessionals (including homemaker home health aides) to provide home health services.

(2) In making grants and loans under this subsection, the Secretary shall—(A) consider the relative needs of the several States for home health services;

(B) give preference to areas in which a high percentage of the population proposed to be served is composed of individuals who are elderly, medically indigent, or disabled; and

(C) give special consideration to areas with inadequate means of transportation to obtain necessary health services.


(3)(A) No loan may be made to a proprietary entity under this section unless the application of such entity for such loan contains assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that—(i) at the time the application is made the entity is fiscally sound;

(ii) the entity is unable to secure a loan for the project for which the application is submitted from non-Federal lenders at the rate of interest prevailing in the area in which the entity is located; and

(iii) during the period of the loan, such entity will remain fiscally sound.


(B) Loans under this section shall be made at an interest rate comparable to the rate of interest prevailing on the date the loan is made with respect to the marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities, adjusted to provide for administrative costs.
