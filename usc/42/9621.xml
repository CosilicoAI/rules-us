Cleanup standards(a) Selection of remedial actionThe President shall select appropriate remedial actions determined to be necessary to be carried out under section 9604 of this title or secured under section 9606 of this title which are in accordance with this section and, to the extent practicable, the national contingency plan, and which provide for cost-effective response. In evaluating the cost effectiveness of proposed alternative remedial actions, the President shall take into account the total short- and long-term costs of such actions, including the costs of operation and maintenance for the entire period during which such activities will be required.


(b) General rules(1) Remedial actions in which treatment which permanently and significantly reduces the volume, toxicity or mobility of the hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants is a principal element, are to be preferred over remedial actions not involving such treatment. The offsite transport and disposal of hazardous substances or contaminated materials without such treatment should be the least favored alternative remedial action where practicable treatment technologies are available. The President shall conduct an assessment of permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies that, in whole or in part, will result in a permanent and significant decrease in the toxicity, mobility, or volume of the hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. In making such assessment, the President shall specifically address the long-term effectiveness of various alternatives. In assessing alternative remedial actions, the President shall, at a minimum, take into account:(A) the long-term uncertainties associated with land disposal;

(B) the goals, objectives, and requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.];

(C) the persistence, toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate of such hazardous substances and their constitue</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9621_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Selection of remedial action</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Selection of remedial action The President shall select appropriate remedial actions determined to be necessary to be carried out under section 9604 of this title or secured under section 9606 of this title which are in accordance with this section and, to the extent practicable, the national contingency plan, and which provide for cost-effective response.

In addition, if upon such review it is the judgment of the President that action is appropriate at such site in accordance with section 9604 or 9606 of this title, the President shall take or require such action. The President shall report to the Congress a list of facilities for which such review is required, the results of all such reviews, and any actions taken as a result of such reviews.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9621_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Degree of cleanup</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Degree of cleanup</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9621_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Permits and enforcement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Permits and enforcement</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9621_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>State involvement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) State involvement</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
