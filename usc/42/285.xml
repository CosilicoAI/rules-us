Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 28, 2016, 81 F.R. 5361, provided:
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Cancer is a leading cause of death, and cancer incidence is expected to increase worldwide in the coming decades. But today, cancer research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs. It is of critical national importance that we accelerate progress towards prevention, treatment, and a cure—to double the rate of progress in the fight against cancer—and put ourselves on a path to achieve in just 5 years research and treatment gains that otherwise might take a decade or more. To that end, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force. There is established, within the Office of the Vice President, a White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force (Task Force), which will focus on making the most of Federal investments, targeted incentives, private sector efforts from industry and philanthropy, patient engagement initiatives, and other mechanisms to support cancer research and enable progress in treatment and care. The Vice President shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.
