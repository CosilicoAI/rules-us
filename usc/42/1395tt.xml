Hospital providers of extended care services(a) Hospital facility agreements; reasonable costs of services(1) Any hospital which has an agreement under section 1395cc of this title may (subject to subsection (b)) enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which its inpatient hospital facilities may be used for the furnishing of services of the type which, if furnished by a skilled nursing facility, would constitute extended care services.

(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, payment to any hospital (other than a critical access hospital) for services furnished under an agreement entered into under this section shall be based upon the reasonable cost of the services as determined under subparagraph (B).

(B)(i) The reasonable cost of the services consists of the reasonable cost of routine services (determined under clause (ii)) and the reasonable cost of ancillary services (determined under clause (iii)).

(ii) The reasonable cost of routine services furnished during any calendar year by a hospital under an agreement under this section is equal to the product of—(I) the number of patient-days during the year for which the services were furnished, and

(II) the average reasonable cost per patient-day, such average reasonable cost per patient-day being the average rate per patient-day paid for routine services during the most recent year for which cost reporting data are available with respect to such services (increased in a compounded manner by the applicable increase for payments for routine service costs of skilled nursing facilities under subsections (a) through (d) of section 1395yy of this title for subsequent cost reporting periods and up to and including such calendar year) under this subchapter to freestanding skilled nursing facilities in the region (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title) in which the facility is located.
