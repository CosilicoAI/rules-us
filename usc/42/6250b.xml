(2) a circumstance, other than that described in paragraph (1), exists that constitutes a regional supply shortage of significant scope and duration and that action taken under this section would assist directly and significantly in reducing the adverse impact of such shortage.


(b) DefinitionFor purposes of this section a “dislocation in the heating oil market” shall be deemed to occur only when—(1) The price differential between crude oil, as reflected in an industry daily publication such as “Platt’s Oilgram Price Report” or “Oil Daily” and No. 2 heating oil, as reported in the Energy Information Administration’s retail price data for the Northeast, increases by more than 60 percent over its 5-year rolling average for the months of mid-October through March (considered as a heating season average), and continues for 7 consecutive days; and

(2) The price differential continues to increase during the most recent week for which price information is available.


(c) Continuing evaluationThe Secretary shall conduct a continuing evaluation of the residential price data supplied by the Energy Information Administration for the Northeast and data on crude oil prices from published sources.


(d) Release of petroleum distillateAfter consultation with the heating oil industry, the Secretary shall determine procedures governing the release of petroleum distillate from the Reserve. The procedures shall provide that—(1) the Secretary may—(A) sell petroleum distillate from the Reserve through a competitive process, or
