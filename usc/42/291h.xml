Judicial review(a) Refusal to approve application; procedure; jurisdiction of court of appealsIf the Surgeon General refuses to approve any application for a project submitted under section 291e of this title or section 291j of this title, the State agency through which such application was submitted, or if any State is dissatisfied with his action under section 291g of this title such State may appeal to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such State is located, by filing a petition with such court within sixty days after such action.
