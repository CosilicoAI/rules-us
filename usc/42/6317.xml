Energy conservation standards for high-intensity discharge lamps, distribution transformers, and small electric motors(a) High-intensity discharge lamps and distribution transformers(1) The Secretary shall, within 30 months after October 24, 1992, prescribe testing requirements for those high-intensity discharge lamps and distribution transformers for which the Secretary makes a determination that energy conservation standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings.

(2) The Secretary shall, within 18 months after the date on which testing requirements are prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1), prescribe, by rule, energy conservation standards for those high-intensity discharge lamps and distribution transformers for which the Secretary prescribed testing requirements under paragraph (1).

(3) Any standard prescribed under paragraph (2) with respect to high-intensity discharge lamps shall apply to such lamps manufactured 36 months after the date such rule is published.


(b) Small electric motors(1) The Secretary shall, within 30 months after October 24, 1992, prescribe testing requirements for those small electric motors for which the Secretary makes a determination that energy conservation standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings.

(2) The Secretary shall, within 18 months after the date on which testing requirements are prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1), prescribe, by rule, energy conservation standards for those small electric motors for which the Secretary prescribed testing requirements under paragraph (1).

(3) Any standard prescribed under paragraph (2) shall apply to small electric motors manufactured 60 months after the date such rule is published or, in the case of small electric motors which require listing or certification by a nationally recognized testing laborat</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6317_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>High-intensity discharge lamps and distribution transformers</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) High-intensity discharge lamps and distribution transformers</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6317_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Small electric motors</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Small electric motors</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6317_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Consideration of criteria under other law</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Consideration of criteria under other law In establishing any standard under this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration the criteria contained in section 6295(n) of this title.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6317_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Prescription of labeling requirements by Secretary</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Prescription of labeling requirements by Secretary The Secretary shall, within six months after the date on which energy conservation standards are prescribed by the Secretary for high-intensity discharge lamps and distribution transformers pursuant to subsection (a)(2) and small electric motors pursuant to subsection (b)(2), prescribe labeling requirements for such lamps, transformers, and small electric motors.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6317_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Compliance by manufacturers with labeling requirements</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Compliance by manufacturers with labeling requirements Beginning on the date which occurs six months after the date on which a labeling rule is prescribed for a product under subsection (d), each manufacturer of a product to which such a rule applies shall provide a label which meets, and is displayed in accordance with, the requirements of such rule.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6317_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>New covered products; distribution of non-conforming products prohibited; construction with other law</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) New covered products; distribution of non-conforming products prohibited; construction with other law</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
