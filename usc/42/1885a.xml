Women in science and engineering; support of activities by Foundation for promotion, etc.
The Foundation is authorized to—(1) support activities designed to—(A) increase the participation of women in courses of study at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels leading to degrees in scientific and engineering fields;

(B) encourage women to consider and prepare for careers in science and engineering; or

(C) provide traineeship and fellowship opportunities for women in science and engineering;


(2) support programs in science, engineering, and mathematics in elementary and secondary schools so as to stimulate the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and information by female students and to increase female student awareness of career opportunities requiring scientific and engineering skills;

(3) support activities in continuing education in science and engineering which provide opportunities for women who—(A) are in the work force, or

(B) who are not in the work force because their careers have been interrupted,


to acquire new knowledge, techniques, and skills in scientific and engineering fields;

(4) undertake a comprehensive research program designed to increase public understanding of (A) the potential contribution of women in science and engineering and (B) the means to facilitate the participation and advancement of women in scientific and engineering careers;

(5) establish a visiting women scientists and engineers program;

(6) support activities designed to improve the availability and quality of public information concerning the importance of the participation of women in careers in science and engineering;

(7) support activities of museums and science centers which demonstrate potential to interest and involve women in science and engineering;

(8) make grants, to be known as the National Research Opportunity Grants, to women scientists and engineers who (A) have received their doctorates within five years prior to the date of the a</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) support activities designed to—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) support programs in science, engineering, and mathematics in elementary and secondary schools so as to stimulate the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and information by female students and to increase female student awareness of career opportunities requiring scientific and engineering skills;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) support activities in continuing education in science and engineering which provide opportunities for women who— to acquire new knowledge, techniques, and skills in scientific and engineering fields;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) undertake a comprehensive research program designed to increase public understanding of (A) the potential contribution of women in science and engineering and (B) the means to facilitate the participation and advancement of women in scientific and engineering careers;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) establish a visiting women scientists and engineers program;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) support activities designed to improve the availability and quality of public information concerning the importance of the participation of women in careers in science and engineering;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(7) support activities of museums and science centers which demonstrate potential to interest and involve women in science and engineering;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(8) make grants, to be known as the National Research Opportunity Grants, to women scientists and engineers who (A) have received their doctorates within five years prior to the date of the award or (B) have received their doctorates, have had their careers interrupted, and are re-entering the work force within five years after such interruption;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_9"><akn:num>(9)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(9) make grants to women eligible under paragraph (8) to assist such women in planning and developing a research project eligible for support under such paragraph;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1885a_10"><akn:num>(10)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(10) provide support to individuals or academic institutions for full-time or part-time visiting professorships for women in science and engineering;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
