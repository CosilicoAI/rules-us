Assisted reproductive technology programs(a) In generalEffective 2 years after October 24, 1992, each assisted reproductive technology (as defined in section 263a–7 11 See References in Text note below. of this title) program shall annually report to the Secretary through the Centers for Disease Control—(1) pregnancy success rates achieved by such program through each assisted reproductive technology, and

(2) the identity of each embryo laboratory (as defined in section 263a–7 1 of this title) used by such program and whether the laboratory is certified under section 263a–2 of this title or has applied for such certification.


(b) Pregnancy success rates(1) In generalFor purposes of subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall, in consultation with the organizations referenced in subsection (c), define pregnancy success rates and shall make public any proposed definition in such manner as to facilitate comment from any person (including any Federal or other public agency) during its development.


(2) DefinitionIn developing the definition of pregnancy success rates, the Secretary shall take into account the effect on success rates of age, diagnosis, and other significant factors and shall include in such rates—(A) the basic live birth rate calculated for each assisted reproductive technology performed by an assisted reproductive technology program by dividing the number of pregnancies which result in live births by the number of ovarian stimulation procedures attempted by such program, and

(B) the live birth rate per successful oocyte retrieval procedure calculated for each assisted reproductive technology performed by an assisted reproductive technology program by dividing the number of pregnancies which result in live births by the number of successful oocyte retrieval procedures performed by such program.
