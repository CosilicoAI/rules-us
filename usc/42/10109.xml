(2) Spent nuclear fuelThe term “spent nuclear fuel” has the meaning given the term in section 2 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101).


(3) Standard contractThe term “standard contract” has the meaning given the term “contract” in section 961.3 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).
