Payments under project grant agreements(a) General Authority.—After making a project grant agreement under this subchapter and consulting with the sponsor, the Secretary of Transportation may decide when and in what amounts payments under the agreement will be made. Payments totaling not more than 90 percent of the United States Government’s share of the project’s estimated allowable costs may be made before the project is completed if the sponsor certifies to the Secretary that the total amount expended from the advance payments at any time will not be more than the cost of the airport development work completed on the project at that time.

(b) Recovering Payments.—If the Secretary determines that the total amount of payments made under a grant agreement under this subchapter is more than the Government’s share of the total allowable project costs, the Government may recover the excess amount. If the Secretary finds that a project for which an advance payment was made has not been completed within a reasonable time, the Government may recover any part of the advance payment for which the Government received no benefit.

(c) Payment Deposits.—A payment under a project grant agreement under this subchapter may be made only to an official or depository designated by the sponsor and authorized by law to receive public money.

(d) Withholding Payments.—(1) The Secretary may withhold a payment under a grant agreement under this subchapter for more than 180 days after the payment is due only if the Secretary—(A) notifies the sponsor and provides an opportunity for a hearing; and

(B) finds that the sponsor has violated the agreement.


(2) The 180-day period may be extended by—(A) agreement of the Secretary and the sponsor; or

(B) the hearing officer if the officer decides an extension is necessary because the sponsor did not follow the schedule the officer established.
