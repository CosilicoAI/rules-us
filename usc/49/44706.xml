(3) that the Administrator requires to have a certificate;


if the Administrator finds, after investigation, that the person properly and adequately is equipped and able to operate safely under this part and regulations and standards prescribed under this part.

(b) Terms.—An airport operating certificate issued under this section shall contain terms necessary to ensure safety in air transportation.
