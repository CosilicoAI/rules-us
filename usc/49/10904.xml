(D) the foregone tax benefits from not retiring properties from rail service and other effects of applicable Federal and State income taxes; and


(2) the term “reasonable return” means—(A) if a rail carrier is not in reorganization, the cost of capital to the rail carrier, as determined by the Board; and

(B) if a rail carrier is in reorganization, the mean cost of capital of rail carriers not in reorganization, as determined by the Board.



(b) Any rail carrier which has filed an application for abandonment or discontinuance shall provide promptly to a party considering an offer of financial assistance and shall provide concurrently to the Board—(1) an estimate of the annual subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line or a portion of the line in operation;
