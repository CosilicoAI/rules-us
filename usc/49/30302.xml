National Driver Register(a) Establishment and Contents.—The Secretary of Transportation shall establish as soon as practicable and maintain a National Driver Register to assist chief driver licensing officials of participating States in exchanging information about the motor vehicle driving records of individuals. The Register shall contain an index of the information reported to the Secretary under section 30304 of this title. The Register shall enable the Secretary (electronically or, until all States can participate electronically, by United States mail)—(1) to receive information submitted under section 30304 of this title by the chief driver licensing official of a State of record;

(2) to receive a request for information made by the chief driver licensing official of a participating State under section 30305 of this title;

(3) to refer the request to the chief driver licensing official of a State of record; and

(4) in response to the request, to relay information provided by a chief driver licensing official of a State of record to the chief driver licensing official of a participating State, without interception of the information.


(b) Accuracy of Information.—The Secretary is not responsible for the accuracy of information relayed to the chief driver licensing official of a participating State. However, the Secretary shall maintain the Register in a way that ensures against inadvertent alteration of information during a relay. The Secretary shall make continual improvements to modernize the Register’s data processing system.
