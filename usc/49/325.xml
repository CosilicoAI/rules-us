In subsection (a), the words “provisions of title 5 governing appointment in the competitive service” are substituted for “civil service laws” in 49:1657(o) for clarity and consistency. The words “as shall be appropriate for the purpose of” before “consultation” in 49:1657(o) are omitted as surplus. The words “the Secretary in carrying out the duties and powers of the Secretary” are substituted for “the Department in performance of its functions” in 49:1657(o) and “the Administration in performance of its functions hereunder” in 49:1343(g) for clarity and consistency because the duties and powers are vested in the Secretary of Transportation.
