(c) Included for any position listed shall be—(1) a brief description of the position, including its title, tenure, location, and rate of pay;

(2) application procedures, including the period within which applications may be submitted and procedures for obtaining additional information; and

(3) any other information which the Office considers appropriate.


(d) The list shall be available to members of the public.

(e) The Office shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.
