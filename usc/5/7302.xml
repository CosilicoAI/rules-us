Editorial Notes

References in TextThe effective date of the amendments made by section 1106 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, referred to in subsec. (a), probably means the effective date of the amendments made by section 1125 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. 108–136, which enacted this section. Pub. L. 108–136 does not contain a section 1106, and the provisions appearing in section 1106 of H.R. 1588, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, as passed by the House of Representatives on May 22, 2003, were contained in section 1125 of Pub. L. 108–136. For effective date of amendments made by section 1125 of Pub. L. 108–136, see section 1125(c) of Pub. L. 108–136, set out as an Effective Date of 2003 Amendment note under section 5304 of this title.
