Coverage of restored employees and survivor or disability annuitants(a) An employee enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter who is removed or suspended without pay and later reinstated or restored to duty on the ground that the removal or suspension was unjustified or unwarranted may, at his option, enroll as a new employee or have his coverage restored, with appropriate adjustments made in contributions and claims, to the same extent and effect as though the removal or suspension had not taken place.

(b) A surviving spouse whose survivor annuity under this title was terminated because of remarriage and is later restored may, under such regulations as the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, enroll in a health benefits plan described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title if such spouse was covered by any such plan immediately before such annuity was terminated.

(c) A disability annuitant whose disability annuity under section 8337 of this title was terminated and is later restored under the second or third sentence of subsection (e) of such section may, under regulations prescribed by the Office, enroll in a health benefits plan described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title if such annuitant was covered by any such plan immediately before such annuity was termi­nated.

(d) A surviving child whose survivor annuity under section 8341(e) or 8443(b) was terminated and is later restored under paragraph (4) of section 8341(e) or the last sentence of section 8443(b) may, under regulations prescribed by the Office, enroll in a health benefits plan described by section 8903 or 8903a if such surviving child was covered by any such plan immediately before such annuity was terminated.
