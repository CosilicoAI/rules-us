Dual employment and pay during terminal leave from uniformed services
A member of a uniformed service who has performed active service and who is on terminal leave pending separation from, or release from active duty in, that service under honorable conditions may accept a civilian office or position in the Government of the United States, its territories or possessions, or the government of the District of Columbia, and he is entitled to receive the pay of that office or position in addition to pay and allowances from the uniformed service for the unexpired portion of the terminal leave. Such a member also is entitled to accrue annual leave with pay in the manner specified in section 6303(a) of this title for a retired member of a uniformed service.
(Added Pub. L. 90–83, § 1(22), Sept. 11, 1967, 81 Stat. 199; amended Pub. L. 109–364, div. A, title XI, § 1101, Oct. 17, 2006, 120 Stat. 2407.)

Historical and Revision NotesThis section amends chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code, by inserting a new section 5534a. This section is based on subsections (a) and (f) of former 5 U.S.C. 61a–1 the source statute for which (act of Nov. 21, 1945, ch. 489, 59 Stat. 584) was repealed by the act of September 6, 1966, Public Law 89–554 (sec. 8, 80 Stat. 653). Senate Report 1380, 89th Congress, second session, pages 449, 511, explains that the source was repealed since it had been rendered obsolete by section 4(c) of the Armed Forces Leave Act of 1946, as amended (37 U.S.C. 501), and section 219(c) of the Public Health Service Act, as added August 9, 1950 (ch. 654, sec. 2, 64 Stat. 426; 42 U.S.C. 210–1(c)), and that any existing rights are preserved by section 8 of Public Law 89–554.
At the time of enactment of the act of November 21, 1945, there was no authority to make lump-sum leave payments to members of the uniformed services who were being separated from or released from active duty in the uniformed services. Accordingly, they were placed on terminal leave until </akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
