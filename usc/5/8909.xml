Employees Health Benefits Fund(a) There is in the Treasury of the United States an Employees Health Benefits Fund which is administered by the Office of Personnel Management. The contributions of enrollees and the Government described by section 8906 of this title shall be paid into the Fund. The Fund is available—(1) without fiscal year limitation for all payments to approved health benefits plans; and

(2) to pay expenses for administering this chapter within the limitations that may be specified annually by Congress, except that the amounts required to be set aside under subsection (b)(2) shall not be subject to the limitations that may be specified annually by Congress.


Payments from the Fund to a plan participating in a letter-of-credit arrangement under this chapter shall, in connection with any payment or reimbursement to be made by such plan for a health service or supply, be made, to the maximum extent practicable, on a checks-presented basis (as defined under regulations of the Department of the Treasury).

(b) Portions of the contributions made by enrollees and the Government shall be regularly set aside in the Fund as follows:(1) A percentage, not to exceed 1 percent of all contributions, determined by the Office to be reasonably adequate to pay the administrative expenses made available by subsection (a) of this section.

(2) In fiscal year 2026, $66,000,000, to be derived from all contributions, and to remain available until the end of fiscal year 2035, for the Director of the Office to carry out subsections (c) through (f) of the FEHB Protection Act of 2025.

(3) For each health benefits plan, a percentage, not to exceed 3 percent of the contributions toward the plan, determined by the Office to be reasonably adequate to provide a contingency reserve.
