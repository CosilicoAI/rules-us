Assignment of employees to State or local governments(a) An employee of a Federal agency assigned to a State or local government under this subchapter is deemed, during the assignment, to be either—(1) on detail to a regular work assignment in his agency; or

(2) on leave without pay from his position in the agency.


An employee assigned either on detail or on leave without pay remains an employee of his agency.

(b) The assignment of an employee of a Federal agency either on detail or on leave without pay to a State or local government under this subchapter may be made with or without reimbursement by the State or local government for the travel and transportation expenses to or from the place of assignment and for the pay, or supplemental pay, or a part thereof, of the employee during assignment. Any reimbursements shall be credited to the appropriation of the Federal agency used for paying the travel and transportation expenses or pay.

(c) For any employee so assigned and on leave without pay—(1) if the rate of pay for his employment by the State or local government is less than the rate of pay he would have received had he continued in his regular assignment in the agency, he is entitled to receive supplemental pay from the agency in an amount equal to the difference between the State or local government rate and the agency rate;

(2) he is entitled to annual and sick leave to the same extent as if he had continued in his regular assignment in the agency; and

(3) he is entitled, notwithstanding other statutes—(A) to continuation of his insurance under chapter 87 of this title, and coverage under chapter 89 of this title or other applicable authority, so long as he pays currently into the Emplo</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3373_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) An employee of a Federal agency assigned to a State or local government under this subchapter is deemed, during the assignment, to be either— An employee assigned either on detail or on leave without pay remains an employee of his agency.
