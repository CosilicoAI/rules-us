 [Uncodified].1949 Reorg. Plan No. 5, § 4, eff. Aug. 19, 1949, 63 Stat. 1069.


In subsection (a), the words “the District of Columbia” are substituted for “Washington”. The words “at least three individuals in the service of the United States” are substituted for a “a suitable number of persons, not less than three, in the official service of the United States”. So much of the first three sentences of former section 635 as related to the offices of the Chief Examiner and the Secretary are omitted because the offices were abolished by 1949 Reorg. Plan No. 5, § 4. So much of the first sentence as imposed a duty on the Chief Examiner, under the Commission’s direction, to act with the examining boards to secure accuracy, uniformity, and justice in all their proceedings is restated in section 1104(a)(1). The fourth sentence of former section 635, authorizing the Commission to employ a stenographer and a messenger, is omitted as obsolete. The remainder is rewritten for clarity. The text of 1949 Reorg. Plan No. 5, § 4, is omitted as executed.
In subsection (b), the words “Chairman, United States Civil Service Commission” are substituted for “chief examiner” on authority of 1949 Reorg. Plan No. 5, § 2(a)(2). The words “at all times” are omitted as surplusage.
