(b) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which—(1) an eligible individual may enroll in a dental benefits plan; and

(2) an enrolled individual may change the self-only, self plus one, or self and family coverage of that individual.


(c)(1) Regulations under subsection (b) shall permit an eligible individual to cancel or transfer the enrollment of that individual to another dental benefits plan—(A) before the start of any contract term in which there is a change in rates charged or benefits provided, in which a new plan is offered, or in which an existing plan is terminated; or

(B) during other times and under other circumstances specified by the Office.


(2) A transfer under paragraph (1) shall be subject to waiting periods provided under a new plan.


(d) Coverage under a dental benefits plan under this chapter for any employee or a covered TRICARE-eligible individual enrolled in such a plan and who, as a result of a lapse in appropriations, is furloughed or excepted from furlough and working without pay shall continue during such lapse and may not be cancelled as a result of nonpayment of premiums or other periodic charges due to such lapse.
