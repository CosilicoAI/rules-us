Increase or decrease of basic compensation(a) If an individual—(1) was a minor or employed in a learner’s capacity at the time of injury; and

the Secretary of Labor, on review under section 8128 of this title after the time the wage-earning capacity of the individual would probably have increased but for the injury, shall recompute prospectively the monetary compensation payable for disability on the basis of an assumed monthly pay corresponding to the probable increased wage-earning capacity.
