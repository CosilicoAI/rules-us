 5 U.S.C. 103.June 7, 1897, ch. 3, § 1 (last proviso on p. 86), 30 Stat. 86.


The words “a military department” are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser’s note for section 301.
Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
