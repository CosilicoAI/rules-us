 5 U.S.C. 633(4).Jan. 16, 1883, ch. 27, § 2(4), 22 Stat. 404.


The authority of the President to prescribe rules is carried into sections 2951, 3302, 3304(a), 3306(a), 3321, 7152, 7153, 7321, and 7322 of this title.
In paragraph (2), the words “in respect to the execution of this act” are changed to “concerning the execution of the provisions of this title that relate to the administration of the competitive service” to avoid having to refer in the text to the sections of this title into which the Civil Service Act, the act referred to, is codified. These sections are: 1101, 1102, 1105, 1302(a), 1303, 1307, 1308(a)(1), 2102, 2951, 3302, 3303, 3304(a), (d), 3305(a), 3306, 3318(a), 3319(a), 3321, 7152, 7153, 7321, 7322, and 7352. The words “the provisions of this title that relate to the administration of the competitive service” will include some of the sections derived from the Veterans’ Preference Act of 1944 (former sections 851–869). They are based in part on former section 860 (codified in § 1302(c)).
