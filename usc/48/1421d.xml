Editorial Notes
Amendments1968—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 90–497, § 9(a), repealed subsec. (c) which provided for the payment of transportation expenses by the United States of all officers and employees of the government of Guam if their homes were outside Guam.
Pub. L. 90–497, § 9(b), removed subsection designations and substituted provisions that the government of Guam pay the salaries and travel expenses of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, heads of executive departments, members of the legislature, and government officers and employees at rates prescribed by the laws of Guam for provisions setting the salary for the Governor and Secretary of Guam and allowing for the payment of transportation expenses and salaries of certain officers and employees by the United States.
1965—Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 89–100 substituted provisions empowering the government of Guam to fix and pay legislative salaries and expenses for provisions which specifically fixed a sum of $15 per day to be paid each member for every day the legislature is in session payable out of Congressional appropriations and which required all other expenses to be paid by the government of Guam.
1956—Subsec. (a). Act Aug. 1, 1956, substituted “the Governor of the Virgin Islands in the Executive Pay Act of 1949, as heretofore or hereafter amended,” for “Governors of Territories and possessions in the Executive Pay Act of 1949, but not to exceed $13,125,”.
