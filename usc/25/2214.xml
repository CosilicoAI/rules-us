Editorial Notes

References in TextThis chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, which was translated as reading “this title”, meaning title II of Pub. L. 97–459, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

Amendments2005—Pub. L. 109–157 substituted “Such a system may govern the amounts offered for the purchase of interests in trust or restricted land under this chapter.” for “Such system may govern the amounts offered for the purchase of interests in trust or restricted lands under this chapter.”
2004—Pub. L. 108–374, which directed substitution of “this Act” for “section 2212 of this title” in last sentence, was executed by substituting “this chapter” for “section 213”, meaning section 213 of Pub. L. 97–459, which is classified to section 2212 of this title, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
