Leases for mining purposes of unallotted lands in Kaw Reservation
The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to lease for mining purposes lands reserved from allotment to be used as a cemetery and not needed for that purpose, and lands reserved for school and agency purposes in the Kaw Reservation in the State of Oklahoma, and for the use and benefit of the members of the Kansas or Kaw Tribe of Indians, at public auction, upon such terms and conditions and under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe: Provided, That the production of oil and gas and other minerals on such lands may be taxed by the State in which said lands are located in all respects the same as production on unrestricted lands, and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to cause to be paid the tax so assessed against the royalty interests on said lands: Provided, however, That such tax shall not become a lien or charge of any kind or character against the land or the property of the Indian owner.
