Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 318 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 195, 35 Stat. 1125).
The provisions of said section 318 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were incorporated in this section and section 1703 of this title.
The fine of “$500” was increased to “$2,000” as more proportionate to the imprisonment provision and to conform with other comparable sections. (See sections 1702 and 1708 of this title.)
Changes were made in phraseology.
