Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 220 of title 22, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse (June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title IX, § 2, 40 Stat. 227; Mar. 28, 1940, ch. 72, § 7, 54 Stat. 80).
Mandatory-punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
Punishment of five years’ imprisonment was substituted for “ten years” to conform with other sections embracing offenses of comparable gravity.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.
