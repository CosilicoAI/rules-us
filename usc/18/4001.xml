Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1934 ed., §§ 741 and 753e (Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 529, §§ 1, 4, 26 Stat. 839; May 14, 1930, ch. 274, § 6, 46 Stat. 326).
This section consolidates said sections 741 and 753e with such changes of language as were necessary to effect consolidation.
“The Classification Act, as amended,” was inserted more clearly to express the existing procedure for appointment of officers and employees as noted in letter of the Director of Bureau of Prisons, June 19, 1944.

Editorial Notes

References in TextThe Classification Act, as amended, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), originally was the Classification Act of 1923, Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488, which was repealed by section 1202 of the Classification Act of 1949, Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782, 63 Stat. 972. Section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the Classification Act of 1923 shall be held and considered to mean the Classification Act of 1949. The Classification Act of 1949 was in turn repealed by Pub. L. 89–554, § 8(a), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 632, and reenacted by the first section thereof </akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4001_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4001_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(b)</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
