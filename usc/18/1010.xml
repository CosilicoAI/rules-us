(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 751; Pub. L. 90–19, § 24(c), May 25, 1967, 81 Stat. 28; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 1731(a) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (June 27, 1934, ch. 847, § 512(a), 48 Stat. 1265; Feb. 3, 1938, ch. 13, § 9, 52 Stat. 24).
Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.
“$5,000” was substituted for “$3,000” to make this section more consistent in its punishment provisions with comparable sections. (See section 1008 of this title.)
Minor changes in phraseology were made.
