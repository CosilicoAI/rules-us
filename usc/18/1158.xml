Counterfeiting Indian Arts and Crafts Board trade mark
Whoever counterfeits or colorably imitates any Government trade mark used or devised by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board in the Department of the Interior as provided in section 305a of Title 25, or, except as authorized by the Board, affixes any such Government trade mark, or knowingly, willfully, and corruptly affixes any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation thereof upon any products, or to any labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, or receptacles intended to be used upon or in connection with the sale of such products; or
Whoever knowingly makes any false statement for the purpose of obtaining the use of any such Government trade mark—
Shall (1) in the case of a first violation, if an individual, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, and, if a person other than an individual, be fined not more than $1,000,000; and (2) in the case of subsequent violations, if an individual, be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or both, and, if a person other than an individual, be fined not more than $5,000,000; and (3) shall be enjoined from further carrying on the act or acts complained of.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 759; Pub. L. 101–644, title I, § 106, Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 4665; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(U), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 305d of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 748, § 5, 49 Stat. 892).
The reference to the offense as a misdemeanor was omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
The words “upon conviction thereof” were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Maximum fine was changed from $2,000 to $500 to bring the offense within the category of petty offenses defined by section 1 of this title. (See revis</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
