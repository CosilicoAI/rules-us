Whoever presents, uses, or attempts to use any such document, record, file, or paper so taken and carried away, to procure the payment of any money from or by the United States, or any officer, employee, or agent thereof, or the allowance or payment of the whole or any part of any claim, account, or demand against the United States—

(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 698; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 92 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 40, 35 Stat. 1096).
Word “employee” was inserted after “officer” in two places to clarify scope of section.
The words “five years” were substituted for “ten years” in the punishment provision to conform to like provisions in similar offenses. (See section 1001 of this title.)
Changes were made in phraseology.

Editorial Notes
Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000”.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
