Whoever reenters or is found within any such reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, after having been removed therefrom or ordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or charge thereof—

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 97 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 45, 35 Stat. 1097; Mar. 28, 1940, ch. 73, 54 Stat. 80).
Reference to territory, Canal Zone, Puerto Rico and the Philippine Islands was omitted as covered by definition of United States in section 5 of this title.
Words “naval or Coast Guard” were inserted before “reservation” and words “yard, station, or installation” were inserted after “arsenal” in two places, so as to extend section to naval or Coast Guard property.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

Editorial Notes
