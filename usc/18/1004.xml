Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 591 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. § 5208; July 12, 1882, ch. 290, § 13, 22 Stat. 166; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, § 7, 40 Stat. 972; Feb. 25, 1927, ch. 191, § 12, 44 Stat. 1231).
Words “be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall” were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
Words “on conviction thereof” were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.
Words “in any district court of the United States” were omitted as unnecessary, because section 3231 of this title confers jurisdiction on Federal district courts of all crimes and offenses defined in this title.
Changes were made in phraseology.
