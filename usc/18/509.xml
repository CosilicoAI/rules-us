Possessing and making plates or stones for Government transportation requests
Whoever, except by lawful authority, controls, holds or possesses any plate, stone, or other thing, or any part thereof, from which has been printed or may be printed any form or request for Government transportation, or uses such plate, stone, or other thing, or knowingly permits or suffers the same to be used in making any such form or request or any part of such a form or request; or
Whoever makes or engraves any plate, stone, or thing, in the likeness of any plate, stone, or thing designated for the printing of the genuine issues of the form or request for Government transportation; or
Whoever prints, photographs, or in any other manner makes, executes, or sells any engraving, photograph, print, or impression in the likeness of any genuine form or request for Government transportation, or any part thereof; or
Whoever brings into the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, any plate, stone, or other thing, or engraving, photograph, print, or other impression of the form or request for Government transportation—
Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 715; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 147 (Dec. 11, 1926, ch. 2, § 2, 44 Stat. 918).
References to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting were omitted as unnecessary as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
Words “upon conviction” in last paragraph were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
Minor changes in phraseology were also made.

Editorial Notes
Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $5,000” in last par.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
