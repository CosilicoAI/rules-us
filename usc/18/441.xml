Postal supply contracts
No contract for furnishing supplies to the Postal Service shall be made with any person who has entered, or proposed to enter, into any combination to prevent the making of any bid for furnishing such supplies, or to fix a price or prices therefor, or who has made any agreement, or given or performed, or promised to give or perform, any consideration whatever to induce any other person not to bid for any such contract, or to bid at a specified price or prices thereon.
Whoever violates this section shall be fined under this title 11 See 1994 Amendment note below. or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the offender is a contractor for furnishing such supplies his contract may be annulled.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 704; Pub. L. 91–375, § 6(j)(4), Aug. 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 777; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 808 of title 39, U.S.C., 1940 ed., The Postal Service (Aug. 24, 1912, ch. 389, § 2, 37 Stat. 553).
Minimum punishment provisions “less than $100 nor” and “less than three months nor” were omitted to conform to policy followed by codifiers of 1909 Criminal Code.
Changes in phraseology were also made.

Editorial Notes
Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–322, which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $10,000”, was executed by making the substitution for “fined not more than $5,000” in second par., to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
1970—Pub. L. 91–375 struck out “Post Office Department or the” before “Postal Service”.
