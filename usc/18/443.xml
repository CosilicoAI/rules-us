(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 704; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 655, § 20(a), 65 Stat. 717; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §§ 330004(17), 330016(2)(F), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2142, 2148.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 119, first and second paragraphs, of title 41 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts (July 1, 1944, ch. 358, § 19(a), 58 Stat. 667).
Section was rewritten with changes of phraseology to conform to the style adopted in the revision.
The definition of “records” was omitted as surplusage in order to avoid any inference that “records” as used in other sections was intended to have a different or more limited connotation than the broad and commonly understood meaning popularly assigned to the term.
