(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 773; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(K), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 421, 422, 425 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§ 246, 247, 250, 35 Stat. 1138, 1139).
Section consolidates and restores three basic sections (act May 25, 1820, ch. 113, §§ 4, 5, 3 Stat. 600, 601; act Apr. 20, 1818, ch. 91, § 4, 3 Stat. 451). As reenacted in the Revised Statutes, such sections were extended and broadened beyond such basic acts. The language at the beginning, “being a citizen or resident of the United States”, was inserted from said section 425 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as enacted originally. While the basic provisions of said sections 421 and 422 are thus broadened, their application as enacted in the 1909 Criminal Code is narrowed.
Designation in said section 421 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., of offender as a “pirate” was omitted as unnecessar</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
