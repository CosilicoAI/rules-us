Marking packages(a) All packages containing any goods, wares, or merchandise manufactured, produced, or mined wholly or in part by convicts or prisoners, except convicts or prisoners on parole or probation, or in any penal or reformatory institution, when shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce shall be plainly and clearly marked, so that the name and address of the shipper, the name and address of the consignee, the nature of the contents, and the name and location of the penal or reformatory institution where produced wholly or in part may be readily ascertained on an inspection of the outside of such package.

(b) Whoever violates this section shall be fined under this title, and any goods, wares, or merchandise transported in violation of this section or section 1761 of this title shall be forfeited to the United States, and may be seized and condemned by like proceedings as those provided by law for the seizure and forfeiture of property imported into the United States contrary to law.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 786; Pub. L. 102–393, title V, § 535(b), Oct. 6, 1992, 106 Stat. 1764; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147; Pub. L. 104–294, title VI, § 601(a)(7), Oct. 11, 1996, 110 Stat. 3498.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 396c, 396d, 396e (July 24, 1935, ch. 412, §§ 2, 3, 4, 49 Stat. 494, 495).
Section consolidates sections 396c, 396d, and 396e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Words “upon conviction thereof” were deleted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.
Words “transported in violation of this section or section 1761” were added after the word “merchandise” to continue existing law.
The provisions of said section 396e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue, were omitted as covered by section 3237 of this title.
Minor changes were made in translations and phraseology.
