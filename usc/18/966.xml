(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 747; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 35, 36 (June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title V, §§ 5, 6, 40 Stat. 222; Mar. 28, 1940, ch. 72, § 5, 54 Stat. 79).
Section consolidates said sections of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
The phrase “by the head of the department or agency charged with the administration of laws relating to clearance of vessels,” was substituted for “by the Secretary of Commerce” in view of Executive Order No. 9083 (F.R. 1609) transferring functions to the Commissioner of Customs.
The conspiracy provision of said section 36 was omitted as covered by section 371 of this title.
