Civil investigative demand(a) Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person or enterprise may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary materials relevant to a racketeering investigation, he may, prior to the institution of a civil or criminal proceeding thereon, issue in writing, and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person to produce such material for examination.

(b) Each such demand shall—(1) state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged racketeering violation which is under investigation and the provision of law applicable thereto;

(2) describe the class or classes of documentary material produced thereunder with such definiteness and certainty as to permit such material to be fairly identified;

(3) state that the demand is returnable forthwith or prescribe a return date which will provide a reasonable period of time within which the material so demanded may be assembled and made available for inspection and copying or reproduction; and

(4) identify the custodian to whom such material shall be made available.


(c) No such demand shall—(1) contain any requirement which would be held to be unreasonable if contained in a subpena duces tecum issued by a court of the United States in aid of a grand jury investigation of such alleged racketeering violation; or

(2) require the production of any documentary evidence which would be privileged from disclosure if demanded by a subpena duces tecum issued by a court of the United States in aid of a grand jury investigation of such alleged racketeering violation.


(d) Service of any such demand or any petition filed under this section may be made upon a person by—(1) delivering a duly executed copy thereof to any partner, executive officer, managing agent, or general agent thereof, or to any agent thereof authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process on behalf of such person, or upon any individua</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1968_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person or enterprise may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary materials relevant to a racketeering investigation, he may, prior to the institution of a civil or criminal proceeding thereon, issue in writing, and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person to produce such material for examination.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1968_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Each such demand shall—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1968_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(c) No such demand shall—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1968_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Service of any such demand or any petition filed under this section may be made upon a person by—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1968_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(e) A verified return by the individual serving any such demand or petition setting forth the manner of such service shall be prima facie proof of such service.
