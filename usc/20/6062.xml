Funding for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that—(1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] was established with the commitment of forty percent Federal funding but currently receives only eight percent Federal funding;

(2) this funding shortfall is particularly burdensome to school districts and schools in low-income areas which serve higher than average proportions of students with disabilities and have fewer local resources to contribute; and

(3) it would cost the Federal Government approximately $10,000,000,000 each year to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.


(b) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Government should provide States and communities with adequate resources under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] as soon as reasonably possible, through the reallocation of noneducation funds within the current budget monetary constraints.
