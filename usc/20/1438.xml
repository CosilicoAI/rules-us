(4) with the written consent of the parents, to continue to provide early intervention services under this subchapter to children with disabilities from their 3rd birthday until such children enter, or are eligible under State law to enter, kindergarten, in lieu of a free appropriate public education provided in accordance with subchapter II; and

(5) in any State that does not provide services for at-risk infants and toddlers under section 1437(a)(4) of this title, to strengthen the statewide system by initiating, expanding, or improving collaborative efforts related to at-risk infants and toddlers, including establishing linkages with appropriate public or private community-based organizations, services, and personnel for the purposes of—(A) identifying and evaluating at-risk infants and toddlers;
