In awarding grants under this part, the Secretary shall give priority to applicants that—(1) demonstrate the greatest need for assistance, based on the expense or difficulty of effectively carrying out approved desegregation plans and the magnet school program for which the grant is sought;

(2) propose to—(A) carry out a new, evidence-based magnet school program;

(B) significantly revise an existing magnet school program, using evidence-based methods and practices, as available; or

(C) replicate an existing magnet school program that has a demonstrated record of success in increasing student academic achievement and reducing isolation of minority groups;


(3) propose to select students to attend magnet school programs by methods such as lottery, rather than through academic examination; and

(4) propose to increase racial integration by taking into account socioeconomic diversity in designing and implementing magnet school programs.
