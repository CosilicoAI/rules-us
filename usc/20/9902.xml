Program requirements
The Director shall replicate and implement undergraduate degree programs under this chapter that—(1) are designed to recruit and prepare students who pursue a baccalaureate degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics to become certified as elementary and secondary teachers;

(2) require the education department (or its equivalent) and the departments or division responsible for preparation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics majors at an institution of higher education to collaborate in establishing and implementing the program at that institution;

(3) require students participating in the program to enter the program through a field-based course and to continue to complete field-based courses supervised by master teachers throughout the program;

(4) hire sufficient teachers so that the ratio of students to master teachers in the program does not exceed 100 to 1;

(5) include instruction in the use of scientifically-based instructional materials and methods, assessments, pedagogical content knowledge (including the interaction between mathematics and science), the use of instructional technology, and how to incorporate State and local standards into the classroom curriculum;

(6) restrict to students participating in the program those courses that are specifically designed for the needs of teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and

(7) require students participating in the program to successfully complete a final evaluation of their teaching proficiency, based on their classroom teaching performance, conducted by multiple trained observers, and a portfolio of their accomplishments.
