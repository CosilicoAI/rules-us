National policy with respect to museums as educational institutions
The Congress, recognizing—(1) that museums serve as sources for schools in providing education for children,

(2) that museums provide educational services of various kinds for educational agencies and institutions and institutions of higher education, and

(3) that the expense of the educational services provided by museums is seldom borne by the educational agencies and institutions taking advantage of the museums’ resources,


declares that it is the sense of the Congress that museums be considered educational institutions and that the cost of their educational services be more frequently borne by educational agencies and institutions benefiting from those services.
