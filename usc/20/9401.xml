Purposes
The purposes of this chapter are—(1) to increase the availability of voluntary programs, services, and activities that support early childhood development, increase parent effectiveness, and promote the learning readiness of young children so that young children enter school ready to learn;

(2) to support parents, child care providers, and caregivers who want to incorporate early learning activities into the daily lives of young children;

(3) to remove barriers to the provision of an accessible system of early childhood learning programs in communities throughout the United States;

(4) to increase the availability and affordability of professional development activities and compensation for caregivers and child care providers; and

(5) to facilitate the development of community-based systems of collaborative service delivery models characterized by resource sharing, linkages between appropriate supports, and local planning for services.

“(3) parent education and parent involvement are critical to the success of any early learning program or activity;

“(4) the more intensively parents are involved in their child’s early learning, the greater the cognitive and noncognitive benefits to their children</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9401_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) to increase the availability of voluntary programs, services, and activities that support early childhood development, increase parent effectiveness, and promote the learning readiness of young children so that young children enter school ready to learn;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9401_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) to support parents, child care providers, and caregivers who want to incorporate early learning activities into the daily lives of young children;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9401_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) to remove barriers to the provision of an accessible system of early childhood learning programs in communities throughout the United States;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9401_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) to increase the availability and affordability of professional development activities and compensation for caregivers and child care providers; and</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9401_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) to facilitate the development of community-based systems of collaborative service delivery models characterized by resource sharing, linkages between appropriate supports, and local planning for services.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
