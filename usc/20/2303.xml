Editorial Notes

References in TextThis chapter (as amended by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act), referred to in text, is this chapter as amended by Pub. L. 115–224, July 31, 2018, 132 Stat. 1563.
The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006, as in effect on the day before July 31, 2018, referred to in text, probably means the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, which is classified generally to this chapter, as in effect on the day before the enactment of Pub. L. 115–224, July 31, 2018, 132 Stat. 1563, which amended this chapter extensively. A prior version of the Act was named the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998, but no act with the title “Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006” has been enacted.
