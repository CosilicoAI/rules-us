L. 89–10, which was formerly classified to section 881 of this title. Section 801 of that Act was renumbered section 1001 of title X by Pub. L. 95–561, title VIII, § 801(1), (2), Nov. 1, 1978, 92 Stat. 2284, and was reclassified to section 3381 of this title.

L. 100–297, title I, § 1002, Apr. 28, 1988, 102 Stat. 293, and, as so amended, did not contain subsections or specific definitions. Section 8001 was subsequently omitted in the general amendment of Pub. L. 89–10 by Pub. L. 103–382, title I, § 101, Oct. 20, 1994, 108 Stat. 3519. For definitions, see section 7801 of this title.
