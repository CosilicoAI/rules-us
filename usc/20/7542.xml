Findings
Congress finds and declares the following:(1) It is the policy of the Federal Government to maximize the leadership of and participation by Alaska Natives in the planning and the management of Alaska Native education programs and to support efforts developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for all students.

(2) Many Alaska Native children enter and exit school with serious educational disadvantages.

(3) Overcoming the magnitude of the geographic challenges, historical inequities, and other barriers to successfully improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native students in rural, village, and urban settings is challenging. Significant disparities between academic achievement of Alaska Native students and non-Native students continue, including lower graduation rates, increased school dropout rates, and lower achievement scores on standardized tests.

(4) The preservation of Alaska Native cultures and languages and the integration of Alaska Native cultures and languages into education, positive identity development for Alaska Native students, and local, place-based, and culture-based programming are critical to the attainment of educational success and the long-term well-being of Alaska Native students.

(5) Improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native students increases access to employment opportunities.

(6) The Federal Government should lend support to efforts developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for Alaska Native students. In 1983, pursuant to Public Law 98–63, Alaska ceased to receive educational funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Bureau of Indian Education does not operate any schools in Alaska, nor operate or fund Alaska Native education programs. The program under this part supports the Federal trust responsibility of the United States to Alaska Natives.
