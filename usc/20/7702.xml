Payments relating to Federal acquisition of real property(a) In generalWhere the Secretary, after consultation with any local educational agency and with the appropriate State educational agency, determines—(1) that the United States owns Federal property in the local educational agency, and that such property—(A) has been acquired by the United States since 1938;

(C) had an assessed value according to original records (including facsimiles or other reproductions of those records) documenting the assessed value of such property (determined as of the time or times when so acquired) prepared by the local officials referred to in subsection (b)(3) or, when such original records are not available due to unintentional destruction (such as natural disaster, fire, flooding, pest infestation, or deterioration due to age), other records, including Federal agency records, local historical records, or other records that the Secretary determines to be appropriate and reliable, aggregating 10 percent or more of the assessed value of—(i) all real property in the local educational agency (similarly determined as of the time or times when such Federal property was so acquired); or
