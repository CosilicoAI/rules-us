Methods for computing withdrawal liability(a) Determination of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from planThe amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from a plan shall be determined in accordance with subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section.


(b) Factors determining computation of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan(1) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws is the sum of—(A) the employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan’s unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after September 25, 1980, as determined under paragraph (2),

(B) the employer’s proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits at the end of the plan year ending before September 26, 1980, as determined under paragraph (3); and

(C) the employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amounts of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (if any) as determined under paragraph (4).


If the sum of the amounts determined with respect to an employer under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) is negative, the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer shall be zero.

(ii) before the plan year in which the withdrawal of the employer occurs.
