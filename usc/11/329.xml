Historical and Revision Notes
senate report no. 95–989This section, derived in large part from current Bankruptcy Act section 60d [section 96(d) of former title 11], requires the debtor’s attorney to file with the court a statement of the compensation paid or agreed to be paid to the attorney for services in contemplation of and in connection with the case, and the source of the compensation. Payments to a debtor’s attorney provide serious potential for evasion of creditor protection provisions of the bankruptcy laws, and serious potential for overreaching by the debtor’s attorney, and should be subject to careful scrutiny.
