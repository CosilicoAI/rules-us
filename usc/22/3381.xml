Findings
Congress makes the following findings:(1) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) affirmed United States policy “to preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the people on the China mainland and all other peoples of the Western Pacific area”.

(2) Consistent with the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409), the United States has grown its strategic partnership with Taiwan’s vibrant democracy of 23,000,000 people.

(3) The creation of a United States fellowship program with Taiwan would support—(A) a key priority of expanding people-to-people exchanges, which was outlined in President Donald J. Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy;

(B) President Joseph R. Biden’s commitment to Taiwan, “a leading democracy and a critical economic and security partner”, as expressed in his March 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance; and

(C) April 2021 guidance from the Department of State based on a review required under the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (subtitle B of title III of division FF of Public Law 116–260) to “encourage U.S. government engagement with Taiwan that reflects our deepening unofficial relationship”.
