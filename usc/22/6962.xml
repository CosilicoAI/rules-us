Functions of Task Force
The Task Force shall monitor and promote effective enforcement of and compliance with section 1307 of title 19 by performing the following functions:(1) Coordinate closely with the United States Customs Service to promote maximum effectiveness in the enforcement by the Customs Service of section 1307 of title 19 with respect to the products of the People’s Republic of China.

Such investigations may include visits to foreign sites where goods allegedly are being mined, produced, or manufactured in a manner that would lead to prohibition of their importation into the United States under section 1307 of title 19.

(2) Make recommendations to the Customs Service on seeking new agreements with the People’s Republic of China to allow Customs Service officials to visit sites where goods may be mined, produced, or manufactured by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions.
