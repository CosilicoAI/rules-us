Foreign Currency Fluctuations Account(a) Establishment(1) There is established in the Treasury of the United States an account to be known as the “Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Peace Corps, Account”. The account shall be used for the purpose of providing funds to pay expenses for operations of the Peace Corps outside the United States which, as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, exceed the amount appropriated for such expenses.

(2) Funds in the account may be transferred, upon the certification of the Director of the Peace Corps (or the Director’s designee) that the transfer is necessary for the purpose specified in paragraph (1), to the account containing funds appropriated for the expenses of the Peace Corps.


(b) Use of funds in accountFunds transferred under subsection (a) shall be merged with, and be available for the same time period, as the appropriation to which they are applied. Notwithstanding any provision of law limiting the amount of funds the Peace Corps may obligate in any fiscal year, such amount shall be increased to the extent necessary to reflect fluctuations in exchange rates from those used in preparing the budget submission.


(c) Exchange rates applicable to obligationsAn obligation of the Peace Corps payable in the currency of a foreign country may be recorded as an obligation based upon exchange rates used in preparing a budget submission. A change reflecting fluctuations in exchange rates may be recorded as a disbursement is made.


(d) Transfers back to accountFunds transferred from the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Peace Corps, Account may be transferred back to that account—(1) if the funds are not needed to pay obligations incurred because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of foreign countries in the appropriation to which the funds were originally transferred; or

(2) because of subsequent favorable fluctuations in the rates or because other funds are, or become, available to pay such obligations.</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2515_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Establishment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Establishment</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2515_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Use of funds in account</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Use of funds in account Funds transferred under subsection (a) shall be merged with, and be available for the same time period, as the appropriation to which they are applied.
