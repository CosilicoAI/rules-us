(3) the United Nations Secretariat and the United Nations Security Council should take concrete steps to address the coup and ongoing crisis in Burma consistent with United Nations General Assembly resolution 75/287, “The situation in Myanmar,” which was adopted on June 18, 2021.

(2) pushing the United Nations Security Council to consider a resolution that immediately imposes a global arms embargo against Burma to ensure that the Burmese military is not able to obtain weapons and munitions from other nations to further harm, murder, and oppress the people of Burma;
