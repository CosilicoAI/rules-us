Requirements relating to aircraft and other equipment(a) Retention of title to aircraft(1) In general(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any aircraft made available to a foreign country under this part, or made available to a foreign country primarily for narcotics-related purposes under any other provision of law, shall be provided only on a lease or loan basis.

(B) Subparagraph (A) applies to aircraft made available at any time after October 27, 1986 (which was the date of enactment of the International Narcotics Control Act of 1986).


(2) Exceptions(A) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the extent that—(i) the application of that paragraph with respect to particular aircraft would be contrary to the national interest of the United States; and

(ii) the President notifies the appropriate congressional committees in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications under section 2394–1 of this title.


(B) Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to aircraft made available to a foreign country under any provision of law that authorizes property that has been civilly or criminally forfeited to the United States to be made available to foreign countries.


(3) Assistance for leasing of aircraft(A) For purposes of satisfying the requirement of paragraph (1), funds made available for the “Foreign Military Financing Program” under section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2763] may be used to finance the leasing of aircraft under chapter 6 of that Act [22 U.S.C. 2796 et seq.].
