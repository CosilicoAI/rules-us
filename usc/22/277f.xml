Valley Gravity Canal and Storage Project
The Secretary of State, with the approval of the President, shall designate the features of the Valley Gravity Canal and Storage Project which he deems international in character, and shall direct such changes in the general project plan as he deems advisable with respect to such features; and the features so designated shall be built, after consultation with the Bureau of Reclamation as to general design, by the American section of the International Boundary Commission, United States and Mexico, and shall be operated and maintained by said Commission insofar as their operation and maintenance in such manner is, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, necessary because of their international character. The construction, operation, and maintenance of such project shall be pursuant to the Federal reclamation laws, except as hereinbefore provided and except that—(1) In addition to the nonreimbursable allocation to flood control or navigation which may be made by the Secretary of the Interior under section 485h(b) of title 43, the President, after consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Interior, shall allocate such part of the total estimated cost of the project as he deems proper to the protection of American interests from drought hazards resulting from the uncontrolled and unregulated flow of the international portion of the Rio Grande below Old Fort Quitman, Texas. Provisions of law applicable with respect to allocations to flood control under section 485h(b) of title 43, shall, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the foregoing provisions, be applicable in like manner with respect to any allocation made under this subparagraph; and

(2) All revenues received by the United States in connection with the construction, operation, and maintenance of such projects shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

(June 28, 1941, ch. 259, 55 Stat. 338.)
