Congressional findings and declaration of policy
The Congress finds and declares that—(1) it is in the national interest for the United States Government to provide a stable source of financial support to give students in developing countries the opportunity to study in the United States, in order to improve the range and quality of educational alternatives, increase mutual understanding, and build lasting links between those countries and the United States;

(2) providing scholarships to foreign students to study in the United States has proven over time to be an effective means of creating strong bonds between the United States and the future leadership of developing countries and, at the same time, assists countries substantially in their development efforts;

(3) study in United States institutions by foreign students enhances trade and economic relationships by providing strong English language skills and establishing professional and business contacts;

(4) students from families of limited financial means have, in the past, largely not had the opportunity to study in the United States, and scholarship programs sponsored by the United States have made no provision for identifying, preparing, or supporting such students for study in the United States;

(5) it is essential that the United States citizenry develop its knowledge and understanding of the developing countries and their languages, cultures, and socioeconomic composition as these areas assume an ever larger role in the world community;

(6) an undergraduate scholarship program for students of limited financial means from developing countries to study in the United States would complement current assistance efforts in the areas of advanced education and training of people of developing countries in such disciplines as are required for planning and implementation of public and private development activities;
