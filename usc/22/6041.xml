Withholding of foreign assistance from countries supporting Juragua nuclear plant in Cuba(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) President Clinton stated in April 1993 that the United States opposed the construction of the Juragua nuclear power plant because of the concerns of the United States about Cuba’s ability to ensure the safe operation of the facility and because of Cuba’s refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or ratify the Treaty of Tlatelolco.

(2) Cuba has not signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the latter of which establishes Latin America and the Caribbean as a nuclear weapons-free zone.

(3) The State Department, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy have expressed concerns about the construction and operation of Cuba’s nuclear reactors.

(4) In a September 1992 report to the Congress, the General Accounting Office outlined concerns among nuclear energy experts about deficiencies in the nuclear plant project in Juragua, near Cienfuegos, Cuba, including—(A) a lack in Cuba of a nuclear regulatory structure;

(B) the absence in Cuba of an adequate infrastructure to ensure the plant’s safe operation and requisite maintenance;

(C) the inadequacy of training of plant operators;

(D) reports by a former technician from Cuba who, by examining with x-rays weld sites believed to be part of the auxiliary plumbing system for the plant, found that 10 to 15 percent of those sites were defective;

(E) since September 5, 1992, when construction on the plant was halted, the prolonged exposure to the elements, including corrosive salt water vapor, of the primary reactor components; and

(F) the possible inadequacy of the upper portion of the reactors’ dome retention capability to withstand only 7 pounds of pressure per square inch, given that normal atmospheric pressure is 32 pounds per square inch and United States reactors are designed to</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6041_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Findings</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Findings The Congress makes the following findings:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_6041_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Withholding of foreign assistance</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Withholding of foreign assistance</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
