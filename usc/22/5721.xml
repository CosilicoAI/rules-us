(b) International agreementsFor all purposes, including actions in any court in the United States, the Congress approves the continuation in force on and after July 1, 1997, of all treaties and other international agreements, including multilateral conventions, entered into before November 27, 2019, between the United States and Hong Kong, or entered into before November 27, 2019, between the United States and the United Kingdom and applied to Hong Kong, unless or until terminated in accordance with law.
