Director of Diplomatic Security Service
Any such Diplomatic Security Service should be headed by a Director designated by the Secretary of State. The Director should be a career member of the Senior Foreign Service or the Senior Executive Service and should be qualified for the position by virtue of demonstrated ability in the areas of security, law enforcement, management, and public administration. Experience in management or operations abroad should be considered an affirmative factor in the selection of the Director.

Editorial Notes
Amendments1994—Pub. L. 103–236 substituted “Any such” for “The” in first sentence, struck out last sentence which read as follows: “The Director shall act under the supervision and direction of the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security.”, and directed the substitution of “should” for “shall” in first, third, and fourth sentences, which was executed to first, second, and third sentences to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the striking out of last sentence which also was the fourth sentence. See H.Rept. 103–126, pp. 168, 169.
