Congress recognizes that the Government of Israel is developing an economic strategy designed to achieve these goals, and that the Government of Israel intends to adopt a comprehensive, multi-year economic strategy based on prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Congress also recognizes that these policies are being designed to reduce direct involvement of the government in the economic system and to promote private enterprise, important prerequisites for economic stability and sustainable growth.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2186_i"><akn:num>(i)</akn:num><akn:heading>Consultations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(i) Consultations It is the sense of the Congress that, as agreed between the two Governments and in order to further the policies specified in subsection (h), Israel and the United States should continue to engage in consultations concerning economic and financial measures, including structural and other reforms, that Israel should undertake during the pendency of this program to enable its economy to absorb and resettle immigrants and to accommodate the increased debt burden that will result from loans guaranteed pursuant to this section.
