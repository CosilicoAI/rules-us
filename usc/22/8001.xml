Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—(1) preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, the means to produce them, and the means to deliver them are critical objectives for United States foreign policy;

(2) sustaining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and strengthening its implementation, particularly its verification and compliance, is the keystone of United States nonproliferation policy;

(3) the NPT has been a significant success in preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons capabilities and maintaining a stable international security situation;

(4) countries that have never become a party to the NPT and remain outside that treaty’s legal regime pose a potential challenge to the achievement of the overall goals of global nonproliferation, because those countries have not undertaken the NPT obligation to prohibit the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities;

(5) it is in the interest of the United States to the fullest extent possible to ensure that those countries that are not States Party to the NPT are responsible in the disposition of any nuclear technology they develop;

(6) it is in the interest of the United States to enter into an agreement for nuclear cooperation arranged pursuant to section 2153 of title 42 with a country that has never been a State Party to the NPT if—(A) the country has demonstrated responsible behavior with respect to the nonproliferation of technology related to nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them;

(B) the country has a functioning and uninterrupted democratic system of government, has a foreign policy that is congruent to that of the United States, and is working with the United States on key foreign policy initiatives related to nonproliferation;

(C) such cooperation induces the country to promulgate and implement substantially improved protections against the proliferation of technology related to nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, and</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, the means to produce them, and the means to deliver them are critical objectives for United States foreign policy;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) sustaining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and strengthening its implementation, particularly its verification and compliance, is the keystone of United States nonproliferation policy;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) the NPT has been a significant success in preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons capabilities and maintaining a stable international security situation;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) countries that have never become a party to the NPT and remain outside that treaty’s legal regime pose a potential challenge to the achievement of the overall goals of global nonproliferation, because those countries have not undertaken the NPT obligation to prohibit the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) it is in the interest of the United States to the fullest extent possible to ensure that those countries that are not States Party to the NPT are responsible in the disposition of any nuclear technology they develop;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) it is in the interest of the United States to enter into an agreement for nuclear cooperation arranged pursuant to section 2153 of title 42 with a country that has never been a State Party to the NPT if—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(7) the United States should continue its policy of engagement, collaboration, and exchanges with and between India and Pakistan;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(8) strong bilateral relations with India are in the national interest of the United States;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_9"><akn:num>(9)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(9) the United States and India share common democratic values and the potential for increasing and sustained economic engagement;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8001_10"><akn:num>(10)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(10) commerce in civil nuclear energy with India by the United States and other countries has the potential to benefit the people of all countries;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
