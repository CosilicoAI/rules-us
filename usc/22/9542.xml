Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—(1) the Government of the Russian Federation bears responsibility for the continuing violence in Eastern Ukraine, including the death on April 24, 2017, of Joseph Stone, a citizen of the United States working as a monitor for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;

(2) the President should call on the Government of the Russian Federation—(A) to withdraw all of its forces from the territories of Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova;

(B) to return control of the borders of those territories to their respective governments; and

(C) to cease all efforts to undermine the popularly elected governments of those countries;


(3) the Government of the Russian Federation has applied, and continues to apply, to the countries and peoples of Georgia and Ukraine, traditional uses of force, intelligence operations, and influence campaigns, which represent clear and present threats to the countries of Europe and Eurasia;

(4) in response, the countries of Europe and Eurasia should redouble efforts to build resilience within their institutions, political systems, and civil societies;

(5) the United States supports the institutions that the Government of the Russian Federation seeks to undermine, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union;

(6) a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization is critical to maintaining peace and security in Europe and Eurasia;

(7) the United States should continue to work with the European Union as a partner against aggression by the Government of the Russian Federation, coordinating aid programs, development assistance, and other counter-Russian efforts;

(8) the United States should encourage the establishment of a commission for media freedom within the Council of Europe, modeled on the Venice Commission regarding rule of law issues, that would be chartered to provide governments with expert recommendations on maintaining legal and regulatory regimes</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) the Government of the Russian Federation bears responsibility for the continuing violence in Eastern Ukraine, including the death on April 24, 2017, of Joseph Stone, a citizen of the United States working as a monitor for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) the President should call on the Government of the Russian Federation—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) the Government of the Russian Federation has applied, and continues to apply, to the countries and peoples of Georgia and Ukraine, traditional uses of force, intelligence operations, and influence campaigns, which represent clear and present threats to the countries of Europe and Eurasia;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) in response, the countries of Europe and Eurasia should redouble efforts to build resilience within their institutions, political systems, and civil societies;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) the United States supports the institutions that the Government of the Russian Federation seeks to undermine, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization is critical to maintaining peace and security in Europe and Eurasia;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(7) the United States should continue to work with the European Union as a partner against aggression by the Government of the Russian Federation, coordinating aid programs, development assistance, and other counter-Russian efforts;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(8) the United States should encourage the establishment of a commission for media freedom within the Council of Europe, modeled on the Venice Commission regarding rule of law issues, that would be chartered to provide governments with expert recommendations on maintaining legal and regulatory regimes supportive of free and independent media and an informed citizenry able to distinguish between fact-based reporting, opinion, and disinformation;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_9"><akn:num>(9)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(9) in addition to working to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, the United States should work with the individual countries of Europe and Eurasia—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9542_10"><akn:num>(10)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(10) the President of the United States should use the authority of the President to impose sanctions under—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
