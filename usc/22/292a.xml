Demonstration of solar and other renewable energy technologies in foreign countries(a) Use of renewable energy systems in United States buildings in foreign countriesIt is the purpose of this section to provide for the demonstration of solar energy and other renewable energy technologies in foreign countries through the use of such energy in buildings acquired under subsection (a) of section 292 of this title, in order that—(1) countries in which such buildings are located may be given visible incentives to develop and use local solar energy or other renewable energy resources to reduce dependence upon petroleum and petroleum products;

(2) markets may be developed for American solar energy systems and components in order to stimulate investment in such systems and components and to reduce the costs of such systems and components to reasonable levels;

(3) in furtherance of the purpose of section 2151q 11 See References in Text note below. of this title, cooperation may be developed between the United States and other countries in an effort to develop solar energy or other renewable energy systems within a short period of time; and

(4) equipment which is vital to the operation of sensitive systems within United States missions abroad may be made more reliable and less dependent upon interruptible local energy supplies.


(b) Implementation of renewable energy projects by Secretary(1) The Secretary of State shall implement projects for the application of solar energy or other forms of renewable energy in buildings acquired under subsection (a) section 292 of this title.

(2) The Secretary of State shall select projects under paragraph (1) in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. Such projects shall apply available solar energy and other renewable energy technologies, including those for—(A) the heating and cooling of buildings;

(B) solar thermal electric systems;

(C) solar photovoltaic conversion systems;

(D) wind energy systems; and
