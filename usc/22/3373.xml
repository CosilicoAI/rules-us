Meaningful participation of Taiwan in the International Civil Aviation Organization(a) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1) the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) should allow Taiwan to meaningfully participate in the organization, including in ICAO triennial assembly sessions, conferences, technical working groups, meetings, activities, and mechanisms;

(3) coercion by the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Republic of China has ensured the systematic exclusion of Taiwan from meaningful participation in ICAO, significantly undermining the ability of ICAO to ensure the safety and security of global aviation.


(b) Plan for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the International Civil Aviation OrganizationThe Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Transportation, is authorized—(1) to initiate a United States plan to secure Taiwan’s meaningful participation in ICAO, including in ICAO triennial assembly sessions, conferences, technical working groups, meetings, activities, and mechanisms; and

(2) to instruct the United States representative to the ICAO to—(A) use the voice and vote of the United States to ensure Taiwan’s meaningful participation in ICAO, including in ICAO triennial assembly sessions, conferences, technical working groups, meetings, activities, and mechanisms; and

(B) seek to secure a vote at the next ICAO triennial assembly session on the question of Taiwan’s participation in that session.
