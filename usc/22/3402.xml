Supplemental authorization of foreign military sales loan guaranties for Egypt and Israel(a) Congressional findings; use of Arms Export Control Act proceduresThe Congress finds that the legitimate defense interests of Israel and Egypt require a one time extraordinary assistance package due to Israel’s phased withdrawal from the Sinai and Egypt’s shift from reliance on Soviet weaponry. The authorizations contained in this section do not, however, constitute Congressional approval of the sale of any particular weapons system to either country. These sales will be reviewed under the normal procedures set forth in section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2776(b)].

(c) Principal amounts of guaranteed loansFunds made available pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may be used only for guaranties for Egypt and Israel pursuant to section 24(a) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2764(a)]. The principal amount of loans guaranteed with such funds may not exceed $3,700,000,000 of which $2,200,000,000 shall be available only for Israel and $1,500,000,000 shall be available only for Egypt. The principal amount of such guaranteed loans shall be in addition to the aggregate ceiling authorized for the fiscal year 1979 by section 31(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2771(b)].
