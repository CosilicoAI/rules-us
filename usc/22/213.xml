Application for passport; verification by oath of initial passport
Before a passport is issued to any person by or under authority of the United States such person shall subscribe to and submit a written application which shall contain a true recital of each and every matter of fact which may be required by law or by any rules authorized by law to be stated as a prerequisite to the issuance of any such passport. If the applicant has not previously been issued a United States passport, the application shall be duly verified by his oath before a person authorized and empowered by the Secretary of State to administer oaths. Each passport application made available to potential applicants (DS–11) and each passport renewal application made available to current passport holders (DS–82) shall include a form that, if completed, indicates the applicant’s consent to the disclosure of information otherwise protected under section 552a of title 5 (commonly known as the “Privacy Act of 1974”) in the event such applicant is determined to be wrongfully detained by a foreign government. Declining to complete such form shall not affect the issuance of a passport to a qualified applicant or diplomatic efforts to secure the release of a United States national from the custody of a foreign government or entity.
