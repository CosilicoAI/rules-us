Increased participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroad under diplomatic security program(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) State Department policy concerning the advertising of security contracts at Foreign Service buildings has been inconsistent over the years. In many cases, diplomatic and consular posts abroad have been given the responsibility to determine the manner in which the private sector was notified concerning an invitation for bids or a request for proposals with respect to a local guard contract. Some United States foreign missions have only chosen to advertise locally the availability of a local security guard contract abroad.

(2) As a result, many United States security firms that provide local guard services abroad have been unaware that local guard contracts were available for bidding abroad and such firms have been disadvantaged as a result.

(3) Undoubtedly, United States security firms would be interested in bidding on more local guard contracts abroad if such firms knew of the opportunity to bid on such contracts.


(b) ObjectiveIt is the objective of this section to improve the efficiency of the local guard programs abroad administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the Department of State and to ensure maximum competition for local guard contracts abroad concerning Foreign Service buildings.


(c) Participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroadWith respect to local guard contracts for a Foreign Service building which exceed $250,000 and are entered into after February 16, 1990, the Secretary of State shall—(1) establish procedures to ensure that all solicitations for such contracts are adequately advertised in the Commerce and Business Daily;

(2) absent compelling reasons, award such contracts through the competitive process;

(3) in evaluating proposals for such contracts, award contracts to the technically acceptable firm offering the lowest e</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4864_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Findings</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Findings The Congress makes the following findings:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4864_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Objective</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Objective It is the objective of this section to improve the efficiency of the local guard programs abroad administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the Department of State and to ensure maximum competition for local guard contracts abroad concerning Foreign Service buildings.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4864_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroad</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroad With respect to local guard contracts for a Foreign Service building which exceed $250,000 and are entered into after February 16, 1990, the Secretary of State shall—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4864_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Definitions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Definitions For the purposes of this section—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4864_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>United States minority contractors</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) United States minority contractors Not less than 10 percent of the amount of funds obligated for local guard contracts for Foreign Service buildings subject to subsection (c) shall be allocated to the extent practicable for contracts with United States minority small business contractors.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4864_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>United States small business contractors</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) United States small business contractors Not less than 10 percent of the amount of funds obligated for local guard contracts for Foreign Service buildings subject to subsection (c) shall be allocated to the extent practicable for contracts with United States small business contractors.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4864_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Limitation of subcontracting</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Limitation of subcontracting With respect to local guard contracts subject to subsection (c), a prime contractor may not subcontract more than 50 percent of the total value of its contract for that project.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4864_h"><akn:num>(h)</akn:num><akn:heading>Award of local guard and protective service contracts</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(h) Award of local guard and protective service contracts In evaluating proposals for local guard contracts under this section, the Secretary of State may award such contracts on the basis of best value as determined by a cost-technical tradeoff analysis (as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15.101) and, with respect to such contracts for posts that are not high risk, high threat posts (as such term is defined in section 4803 of this title), subject to congressional notification 15-days prior to any such award.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
