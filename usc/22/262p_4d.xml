(2) the financing of programs to promote such charitable, educational, and scientific purposes should be facilitated in the context of reducing and converting sovereign debt of sub-Saharan governments, as encouraged in the final communique of the June 1988 economic summit conference in Toronto, Canada, through such means as—(A) concessional interest rates;

(B) extended repayment periods; or

(C) partial or complete write-offs of debt service obligations.
