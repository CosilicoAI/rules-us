Authority to transfer excess defense articles(a) AuthorizationThe President is authorized to transfer excess defense articles under this section to countries for which receipt of such articles was justified pursuant to the annual congressional presentation documents for military assistance programs, or for programs under part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter, submitted under section 2394 of this title, or for which receipt of such articles was separately justified to the Congress, for the fiscal year in which the transfer is authorized.


(b) Limitations on transfers(1) The President may transfer excess defense articles under this section only if—(A) such articles are drawn from existing stocks of the Department of Defense;

(B) funds available to the Department of Defense for the procurement of defense equipment are not expended in connection with the transfer;

(C) the transfer of such articles will not have an adverse impact on the military readiness of the United States;

(D) with respect to a proposed transfer of such articles on a grant basis, such a transfer is preferable to a transfer on a sales basis, after taking into account the potential proceeds from, and likelihood of, such sales, and the comparative foreign policy benefits that may accrue to the United States as the result of a transfer on either a grant or sales basis;

(E) the President determines that the transfer of such articles will not have an adverse impact on the national technology and industrial base and, particularly, will not reduce the opportunities of entities in the national technology and industrial base to sell new or used equipment to the countries to which such articles are transferred; and

(F) the transfer of such articles is consistent with the policy framework for the Eastern Mediterranean established under section 2373 of this title.
