Management of the Friendship Trust Fund(a) Constituent amountsThe Fund shall consist of—(1) amounts appropriated under sections 2902(d) and (e)(1) of this title;

(2) any other amounts received by the Fund by way of gifts and donations; and

(3) interest and proceeds credited to it under subsection (b) of this section.


(b) Investments by Secretary of Treasury in authorized obligations; issuance of obligations and special obligations; conditions of acquisitionIt shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter referred to as the “Secretary”) to invest such portion of the Fund as is not, in the judgment of the Commission, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investment may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, in interest-bearing obligations of Japan, or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by Japan. For such purposes, the obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the Fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States issued during the preceding two years then forming part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eight of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate.
