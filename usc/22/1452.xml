Editorial Notes
Amendments1982—Pub. L. 97–241 substituted “person in the employ or service of the Government of the United States” for “citizen of the United States”, “section 4085 of this title” for “section 1131(3) of this title”, and “section 5536 of title 5” for “section 1765 of the Revised Statutes”. Prior to the amendment by Pub. L. 97–241, “section 5536 of title 5” had been substituted for “section 1765 of the Revised Statutes” (which was formerly classified to section 70 of title 5) on authority of Pub. L. 89–554, § 7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 631, the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, thereby requiring no change in text.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
