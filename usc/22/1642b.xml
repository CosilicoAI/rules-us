Claims against United States; jurisdiction; limitation; preference; reserve fund
No judicial relief or remedy shall be available to any person asserting a claim against the United States or any officer or agent thereof with respect to any action taken under this subchapter, or any other claim for or on account of the property or proceeds described in section 1642a of this title, or for any other action taken with respect thereto except to the extent that the action complained of constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation, and to such extent the sole judicial relief and remedy available shall be an action brought against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims which action must be brought within one year of August 8, 1958, or it shall be forever barred; and any action so brought shall receive a preference over all actions which themselves are not given preference by statute. No other court shall have original jurisdiction to consider any such claim by mandamus or otherwise. If any action is brought pursuant to this section the Secretary of the Treasury shall set aside an appropriate reserve in the account containing the moneys held pursuant to subsection (a) of section 1642a of this title. Such reserve shall be retained pending a final determination of all issues raised in the action and recovery in any such action shall be limited to and paid out of the moneys so reserved. After a final determination of all issues raised in the action and payment of any judgment against the United States entered pursuant thereto, any balance no longer required to be held in reserve shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of section 1642a of this title. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create (1) any liability against the United States for any action taken pursuant to section 1642c of this title, (2) any liability against the United States in favor of the Government of Czechoslovakia</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
