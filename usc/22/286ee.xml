International cooperation
The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to propose that the Fund adopt the following policies with respect to international lending:(1) In its consultations with a member government on its economic policies pursuant to article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, the Fund should—(A) intensify its examination of the trend and volume of external indebtedness of private and public borrowers in the member country and comment, as appropriate, in its report to the Executive Board from the viewpoint of the contribution of such borrowings to the economic stability of the borrower; and

(B) consider to what extent and in what form these comments might be made available to the international banking community and the public.


(2) As part of any Fund-approved stabilization program, the Fund should give consideration to placing limits on public sector external short- and long-term borrowing.

(3) As a part of its annual report, and at such times as it may consider desirable, the Fund should publish its evaluation of the trend and volume of international lending as it affects the economic situation of lenders, borrowers, and the smooth functioning of the international monetary system.
