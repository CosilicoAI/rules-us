Findings
Congress finds the following:(1) The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights declare that all human beings are created equal and possess certain rights and freedoms, including the fundamental right to participate in the political life and government of their respective countries.

(2) The development of democracy constitutes a long-term challenge that goes through unique phases and paces in individual countries as such countries develop democratic institutions such as a thriving civil society, a free media, and an independent judiciary, and must be led from within such countries, including by nongovernmental and governmental reformers.

(3) Individuals, nongovernmental organizations, and movements that support democratic principles, practices, and values are under increasing pressure from some governments of nondemocratic countries (as well as, in some cases, from governments of democratic transition countries), including by using administrative and regulatory mechanisms to undermine the activities of such individuals, organizations, and movements.

(4) Democratic countries have a number of instruments available for supporting democratic reformers who are committed to promoting effective, nonviolent change in nondemocratic countries and who are committed to keeping their countries on the path to democracy.

(5) United States efforts to promote democracy and protect human rights can be strengthened to improve assistance for such reformers, including through an enhanced role for United States diplomats when properly trained and given the right incentives.

(6) The promotion of democracy requires a broad-based effort with cooperation between all democratic countries, including through the Community of Democracies.
