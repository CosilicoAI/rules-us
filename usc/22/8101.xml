Findings
Congress makes the following findings:(1) The proliferation of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices poses a grave threat to the national security of the United States and its vital national interests.

(2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has proven critical to limiting such proliferation.

(3) For the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be effective, each of the non-nuclear-weapon State Parties must conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and such agreements must be honored and enforced.

(4) Recent events emphasize the urgency of strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. This can best be accomplished by providing IAEA inspectors with more information about, and broader access to, nuclear activities within the territory of non-nuclear-weapon State Parties.

(5) The proposed scope of such expanded information and access has been negotiated by the member states of the IAEA in the form of a Model Additional Protocol to its existing safeguards agreements, and universal acceptance of Additional Protocols by non-nuclear weapons states is essential to enhancing the effectiveness of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

(6) On June 12, 1998, the United States, as a nuclear-weapon State Party, signed an Additional Protocol that is based on the Model Additional Protocol, but which also contains measures, consistent with its existing safeguards agreements with its members, that protect the right of the United States to exclude the application of IAEA safeguards to locations and activities with direct national security significance or to locations or information associated with such activities.

(7) Implementation of the Additional Protocol in the United States in a manner consistent with United States obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty may encourage other parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, especially non-nuclear-weapon State Parties, to conc</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8101_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) The proliferation of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices poses a grave threat to the national security of the United States and its vital national interests.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8101_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has proven critical to limiting such proliferation.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8101_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) For the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be effective, each of the non-nuclear-weapon State Parties must conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and such agreements must be honored and enforced.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8101_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) Recent events emphasize the urgency of strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system.
