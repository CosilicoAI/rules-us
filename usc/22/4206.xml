No fees named in the tariff of consular fees prescribed by order of the President shall be charged or collected by consular officers for the official services to American vessels and seamen.

Editorial Notes
Codification
Section was not enacted as part of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 which comprises this chapter.
Provisions of section 12 of act June 26, 1884 (this section), permitting the Secretary of the Treasury to allow consular officers who are paid in whole or in part by fees such compensation for their services as they would have received but for the prohibition in this section were superseded by section 4223 of this title and were omitted, as was a provision of said section appropriating a sum sufficient for the payment of the compensation herein mentioned.
Section was formerly classified to section 1186 of this title, and prior thereto to section 89 of this title.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
