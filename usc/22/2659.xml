Abolition of Functions
Section 161 of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees [now this section], under which the Secretary of State was required to procure, from time to time, such of the statutes of the several States as might not be in his office, was affected by Reorg. Plan No. 20 of 1950, 2(a), eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3178, 64 Stat. 1272, set out in Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, which abolished such prescribed duty. Such section 2(a) further provided, however, that such abolition should not limit the authority of the Secretary of State to procure copies of such State statutes as may be needed in the performance of his functions.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
