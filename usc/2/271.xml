Codification
As originally enacted, section provided for creation of an office of the legislative counsel to be under the direction of two legislative counsels. In view of nonapplicability of section to Speaker, employee, etc., of the House of Representatives pursuant to section 531 of Pub. L. 91–510, set out as a note under section 281 of this title, section has been revised to limit applicability to Senate and creation therein of Office of Legislative Counsel. See section 281 of this title for provisions establishing Office of the Legislative Counsel for the House of Representatives and section 282 of this title for provisions vesting management, etc., in the Legislative Counsel.
