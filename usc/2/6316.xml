United States Code Annotated or United States Code Service; procurement for Senators
In lieu of the volumes of the Code of Laws of the United States, and the supplements thereto, supplied a Senator under section 212 of title 1, the Secretary of the Senate is authorized and directed to supply to a Senator upon written request of, and as specified by, that Senator—(1) one copy of each of the volumes of the United States Code Annotated being published at the time the Senator takes office, and, as long as that Senator holds office, one copy of each replacement volume, each annual pocket part, and each pamphlet supplementing each such pocket part to the United States Code Annotated; or

(2) one copy of each of the volumes of the United States Code Service being published at the time the Senator takes office, and, as long as that Senator holds office, one copy of each replacement volume and each pocket supplement to the United States Code Service.


A Senator is entitled to make a written request under this paragraph and be supplied such volumes, pocket parts, and supplements the first time he takes office as a Senator and each time thereafter he takes office as a Senator after a period of time during which he has not been a Senator. In submitting such written request, the Senator shall certify that the volumes, pocket parts, or supplements he is to be supplied are to be for his exclusive, personal use. A Senator holding office on July 9, 1971, shall be entitled to file a written request and receive the volumes, pocket parts, and supplements, as the case may be, referred to in this paragraph if such request is filed within 60 days after July 9, 1971. Expenses incurred under this authorization shall be paid from the contingent fund of the Senate.
(Pub. L. 92–51, July 9, 1971, 85 Stat. 129; Pub. L. 92–607, ch. V, § 501, Oct. 31, 1972, 86 Stat. 1504.)
