Section constitutes subsections (a) to (c) of section 139 of act Aug. 2, 1946. Subsection (d) of section 139, which required the two Houses of Congress to make a study of existing permanent appropriations with a view to limiting the number thereof and to recommending what permanent appropriations should be discontinued, and of the disposition of funds resulting from the sale of Government property or services by all departments and agencies in the executive branch of the Government with a view to recommending a uniform system of control with respect to those funds, was omitted from the Code as being of a temporary character.
