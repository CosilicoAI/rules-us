Congressional declaration of policy and purpose(a) Devotion of Space Activities to Peaceful Purposes for Benefit of All Humankind.—Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.

(b) Aeronautical and Space Activities for Welfare and Security of United States.—Congress declares that the general welfare and security of the United States require that adequate provision be made for aeronautical and space activities. Congress further declares that such activities shall be the responsibility of, and shall be directed by, a civilian agency exercising control over aeronautical and space activities sponsored by the United States, except that activities peculiar to or primarily associated with the development of weapons systems, military operations, or the defense of the United States (including the research and development necessary to make effective provision for the defense of the United States) shall be the responsibility of, and shall be directed by, the Department of Defense; and that determination as to which agency has responsibility for and direction of any such activity shall be made by the President.

(c) Commercial Use of Space.—Congress declares that the general welfare of the United States requires that the Administration seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space.

(d) Objectives of Aeronautical and Space Activities.—The aeronautical and space activities of the United States shall be conducted so as to contribute materially to one or more of the following objectives:(1) The expansion of human knowledge of the Earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.

(2) The improvement of the usefulness, performance, speed, safety, and efficiency of aeronautical and space vehicles.

(3) The development and operation of vehicles capable of carrying instruments, equipment, supplies, and living organisms t</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_20102_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Devotion of Space Activities to Peaceful Purposes for Benefit of All Humankind.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humankind.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_20102_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Aeronautical and Space Activities for Welfare and Security of United States.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Congress declares that the general welfare and security of the United States require that adequate provision be made for aeronautical and space activities.
