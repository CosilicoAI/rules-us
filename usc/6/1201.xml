Railroad routing of security-sensitive materials(a) In generalNot later than 9 months after August 3, 2007, the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary, shall publish a final rule based on the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on December 21, 2006, entitled “Hazardous Materials: Enhancing Railroad Transportation Safety and Security for Hazardous Materials Shipments”. The final rule shall incorporate the requirements of this section and, as appropriate, public comments received during the comment period of the rulemaking.


(b) Security-sensitive materials commodity dataThe Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the final rule requires each railroad carrier transporting security-sensitive materials in commerce to, no later than 90 days after the end of each calendar year, compile security-sensitive materials commodity data. Such data must be collected by route, line segment, or series of line segments, as aggregated by the railroad carrier. Within the railroad carrier selected route, the commodity data must identify the geographic location of the route and the total number of shipments by the United Nations identification number for the security-sensitive materials.


(c) Railroad transportation route analysis for security-sensitive materialsThe Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the final rule requires each railroad carrier transporting security-sensitive materials in commerce to, for each calendar year, provide a written analysis of the safety and security risks for the transportation routes identified in the security-sensitive materials commodity data collected as required by subsection (b). The safety and security risks present shall be analyzed for the route, railroad facilities, railroad storage facilities, and high-consequence targets along or in proximity to the route.
