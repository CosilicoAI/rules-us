(b) ActivitiesThe Director, through CyberSentry, shall—(1) enter into strategic partnerships with critical infrastructure owners and operators that, in the determination of the Director and subject to the availability of resources, own or operate regionally or nationally significant industrial control systems that support national critical functions, in order to provide technical assistance in the form of continuous monitoring of industrial control systems and the information systems that support such systems and detection of cybersecurity risks to such industrial control systems and other cybersecurity services, as appropriate, based on and subject to the agreement and consent of such owner or operator;

(2) leverage sensitive or classified intelligence about cybersecurity risks regarding particular sectors, particular adversaries, and trends in tactics, techniques, and procedures to advise critical infrastructure owners and operators regarding mitigation measures and share information as appropriate;

(3) identify cybersecurity risks in the information technology and information systems that support industrial control systems which could be exploited by adversaries attempting to gain access to such industrial control systems, and work with owners and operators to remediate such vulnerabilities;

(4) produce aggregated, anonymized analytic products, based on threat hunting and continuous monitoring and detection activities and partnerships, with findings and recommendations that can be disseminated to critical infrastructure owners and operators; and
