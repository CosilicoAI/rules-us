(2) expert-informed analyses of the risk of the most concerning specific global catastrophic and existential threats, including separate estimates, where reasonably feasible and credible, of each threat for its likelihood of occurrence and its potential consequences, as well as associated uncertainties;

(3) a comprehensive list of potential catastrophic or existential threats, including even those that may have very low likelihood;

(4) technical assessments and lay explanations of the analyzed global catastrophic and existential risks, including their qualitative character and key factors affecting their likelihood of occurrence and potential consequences;

(5) an explanation of any factors that limit the ability of the Secretary to assess the risk both cumulatively and for particular threats, and how those limitations may be overcome through future research or with additional resources, programs, or authorities;

(6) a forecast of if and why global catastrophic and existential risk is likely to increase or decrease significantly in the next 10 years, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as a description of associated un</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_823_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>In general</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) In general Not later than 1 year after December 23, 2022, and every 10 years thereafter, the Secretary, in coordination with the Administrator, shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a report containing a detailed assessment, based on the input and coordination required under section 822 of this title, of global catastrophic and existential risk.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_823_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Matters covered</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Matters covered Each report required under subsection (a) shall include—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_823_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Consultation requirement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Consultation requirement In producing the report required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
