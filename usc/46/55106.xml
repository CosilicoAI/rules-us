Merchandise transferred between barges(a) In General.—On terms and conditions the Secretary of Homeland Security may prescribe by regulation, the Secretary may suspend the application of section 55102 of this title to the transportation of merchandise that is transferred, when moving in the foreign trade of the United States, from a barge certified by the owner or operator as designed specifically for carriage on a vessel and carried regularly on a vessel in foreign trade, to another such barge owned or leased by the same owner or operator. However, this subsection does not apply to transportation between the continental United States and noncontiguous States, territories, or possessions to which the coastwise laws apply.

(b) Reciprocity Requirement for Foreign Vessels.—This section applies to a vessel of foreign registry only if the Secretary of Homeland Security finds, based on information from the Secretary of State, that the government of the nation of registry extends reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States.
