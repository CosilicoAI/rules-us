Complement of inspected vessels(a) The certificate of inspection issued to a vessel under part B of this subtitle shall state the complement of licensed individuals and crew (including lifeboatmen) considered by the Secretary to be necessary for safe operation. A manning requirement imposed on—(1) a sailing school vessel shall consider the participation of sailing school instructors and sailing school students in the operation of that vessel;

(2) a mobile offshore drilling unit shall consider the specialized nature of the unit; and

(3) a tank vessel shall consider the navigation, cargo handling, and maintenance functions of that vessel for protection of life, property, and the environment.


(b) The Secretary may modify the complement, by endorsement on the certificate, for reasons of changed conditions or employment.

(c) A requirement made under this section by an authorized official may be appealed to the Secretary under prescribed regulations.

(d) A vessel to which this section applies may not be operated without having in its service the complement required in the certificate of inspection.

(e) When a vessel is deprived of the service of a member of its complement without the consent, fault, or collusion of the owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in charge of the vessel, the master shall engage, if obtainable, a number of members equal to the number of those of whose services the master has been deprived. The replacements must be of the same or a higher grade or rating than those whose places they fill. If the master finds the vessel is sufficiently manned for the voyage, and replacements are not available to fill all the vacancies, the vessel may proceed on its voyage. Within 12 hours after the vessel arrives at its destination, the master shall report in writing to the Secretary the cause of each deficiency in the complement.
