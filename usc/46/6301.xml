Investigation of marine casualties
The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the immediate investigation of marine casualties under this part to decide, as closely as possible—(1) the cause of the casualty, including the cause of any death;

(4) whether there is evidence that an act subjecting the offender to a civil penalty under the laws of the United States has been committed, so that appropriate action may be undertaken to collect the penalty;

(5) whether there is evidence that a criminal act under the laws of the United States has been committed, so that the matter may be referred to appropriate authorities for prosecution; and

(6) whether there is need for new laws or regulations, or amendment or repeal of existing laws or regulations, to prevent the recurrence of the casualty.
