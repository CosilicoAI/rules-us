Waiver of requirements for warrants and advances(a) When the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General decide that, with sufficient safeguards, existing procedures may be changed to simplify, improve, and economize the control and accounting of public money, they may prescribe joint regulations for waiving any part of the requirements in effect on September 12, 1950, that—(1) warrants be issued and countersigned for the receipt, retention, and disbursement of public money and trust funds; and

(2) amounts be requisitioned and advanced to accountable officials.


(b) Regulations of the Secretary and the Comptroller General may provide for the payment of vouchers by authorized disbursing officials by checks drawn on the general fund of the Treasury. However, the regulations shall provide for appropriate action (including suspension or withdrawal of authority to make payments) against a delinquent disbursing official for any reason related to the official’s accounts.

3326(b)31:66c(b).


In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “in effect on September 12, 1950” are substituted for “existing” for clarity. In clause (2), the words “under each separate appropriation head or otherwise” are omitted as surplus.
In subsection (b), the word “official” is substituted for “officers” for consistency. The word “Treasury” is substituted for “Treasurer of the United States” because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title and Department of the Treasury Order 229 of January 14, 1974 (39 F.R. 2280). The words “in the rendition of their accounts or for other” and “under necessary circumstances” are omitted as surplus.</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3326_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) When the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General decide that, with sufficient safeguards, existing procedures may be changed to simplify, improve, and economize the control and accounting of public money, they may prescribe joint regulations for waiving any part of the requirements in effect on September 12, 1950, that—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3326_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Regulations of the Secretary and the Comptroller General may provide for the payment of vouchers by authorized disbursing officials by checks drawn on the general fund of the Treasury.
