Postponing a distress warrant proceeding(a) A distress warrant proceeding may be postponed for a reasonable time if the Secretary of the Treasury believes the public interest will not be harmed by the postponement.

(b)(1) A person adversely affected by a distress warrant issued under section 3541 of this title may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States. The complaint shall state the kind and extent of the harm. The court may grant an injunction to stay any part of a distress warrant proceeding required by the action after the person applying for the injunction gives a bond in an amount the court prescribes for carrying out a judgment.

(2) An injunction under this subsection does not affect a lien under section 3542(b)(1) of this title. The United States Government is not required to answer in a civil action brought under this subsection.

(3) If the court dissolves the injunction on a finding that the civil action for the injunction was brought only for delay, the court may increase the interest rate imposed on amounts found due against the complainant to not more than 10 percent a year. The judge may grant or dissolve an injunction under this subsection either in or out of court.


(c) A person adversely affected by a refusal to grant an injunction or by dissolving an injunction under subsection (b) of this section may petition a judge of a circuit court of appeals in which the district is located or the Supreme Court justice allotted to that circuit by giving the judge or justice a copy of the proceeding held before the district judge. The judge or justice may grant an injunction or allow an appeal if the judge or justice finds the case requires it.
