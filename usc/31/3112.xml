(2) 2.5 percent of the total amount of bonds and notes issued under the First Liberty Bond Act, the Second Liberty Bond Act, the Third Liberty Bond Act, the Fourth Liberty Bond Act, and the Victory Liberty Loan Act and outstanding on July 1, 1920, less an amount equal to the par amount of obligations of governments of foreign countries that the United States Government held on July 1, 1920; and
