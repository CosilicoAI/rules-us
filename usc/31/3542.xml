Carrying out distress warrants(a) A marshal carrying out a distress warrant issued under section 3541 of this title shall seize the personal property of the official and sell the property after giving 10 days notice of the sale. Notice shall be given by posting an advertisement of the property to be sold in at least 2 public places in the town and county in which the property was taken or the town and county in which the owner of the property resides. If the property does not satisfy the amount due under the warrant, the official may be sent to prison until discharged by law.

(b)(1) The amount due under a warrant is a lien on the real property of the official from the date the distress warrant is issued. The lien shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the appropriate district court until discharged under law.

(2) If the personal property of the official is not enough to satisfy a distress warrant, the marshal shall sell real property of the official after advertising the property for at least 3 weeks in at least 3 public places in the county or district where the property is located. A buyer of the real property has valid title against all persons claiming under the official.


(c) The official shall receive that part of the proceeds of a sale remaining after the distress warrant is satisfied and the reasonable costs and charges of the sale are paid.
