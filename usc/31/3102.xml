Bonds(a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of the Treasury may borrow on the credit of the United States Government amounts necessary for expenditures authorized by law and may issue bonds of the Government for the amounts borrowed and may buy, redeem, and make refunds under section 3111 of this title. The Secretary may issue bonds authorized by this section to the public and to Government accounts at any annual interest rate and prescribe conditions under section 3121 of this title.

(b) The Secretary shall offer the bonds authorized under this section first as a popular loan under regulations of the Secretary that allow the people of the United States as nearly as possible an equal opportunity to participate in subscribing to the offered bonds. However, the bonds may be offered in a way other than as a popular loan when the Secretary decides the other way is in the public interest.

(B) reject or reduce allotments on receiving applications filed after the closing date or for larger amounts;

(C) reject or reduce allotments on receiving applications from incorporated banks and trust companies for their own account and make full allotments or increase allotments to other subscribers; and

(D) prescribe a graduated scale of allotments.


(2) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations applying to all popular loan subscribers similarly situated governing a reduction or increase of an allotment under paragraph (1) of this subsection.


(d) The Secretary may make special arrangements for subscriptions from members of the armed forces. However, bonds issued to those members must be the same as other bonds of the same issue.
