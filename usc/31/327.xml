The words “disbursing and receiving” are substituted for “collection and disbursement”, the word “making” is substituted for “rendition of”, and the word “maintaining” is substituted for “keeping”, for consistency in the revised title. The word “checking” is omitted as being included in “bank”.
In subsection (b), the words “When the Secretary of the Treasury provides a service” are substituted for “When any service authorized by law and directed by the Secretary of the Treasury is performed or to be performed” to eliminate unnecessary words.
