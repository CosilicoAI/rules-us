Definitions
As used in this chapter, the term—(1) “accredited laboratory” means a fastener testing facility used to perform end-of-line testing required by a consensus standard or standards to verify that a lot of fasteners conforms to the grade identification marking called for in the consensus standard or standards to which the lot of fasteners has been manufactured, and which—(A) meets the requirements of ISO/IEC Guide 25 (or another document approved by the Director under section 5411a(c) of this title), including revisions from time-to-time; and

(B) has been accredited by a laboratory accreditation body that meets the requirements of ISO/IEC Guide 58 (or another document approved by the Director under section 5411a(d) of this title), including revisions from time-to-time;


(2) “consensus standard” means the provisions of a document that describes fastener characteristics published by a consensus standards organization or a Federal agency, and does not include a proprietary standard;

(3) “consensus standards organization” means the American Society for Testing and Materials, the American National Standards Institute, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Society of Automotive Engineers, the International Organization for Standardization, any other organization identified as a United States consensus standards organization or a foreign and international consensus standards organization in the Federal Register at 61 Fed. Reg. 50582–83 (September 26, 1996), and any successor organizations thereto;

(4) “Director” means the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology;

(5) “distributor” means a person who purchases fasteners for the purpose of reselling them at wholesale to unaffiliated persons within the United States (an original equipment manufacturer and its dealers shall be considered affiliated persons for purposes of this chapter);
