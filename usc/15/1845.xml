Requirements applicable to loan guarantees(a) Stock dividends or other payments, prohibition; waiverA guarantee agreement made under this chapter with respect to an enterprise shall require that while there is any principal or interest remaining unpaid on a guaranteed loan to that enterprise the enterprise may not—(1) declare a dividend on its common stock; or

(2) make any payment on its other indebtedness to a lender whose loan has been guaranteed under this chapter.


The Board may waive either or both of the requirements set forth in this subsection, as specified in the guarantee agreement covering a loan to any particular enterprise, if it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee.

(b) Managerial changesIf the Board determines that the inability of an enterprise to obtain credit without a guarantee under this chapter is the result of a failure on the part of management to exercise reasonable business prudence in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise, the Board shall require before guaranteeing any loan to the enterprise that the enterprise make such management changes as the Board deems necessary to give the enterprise a sound managerial base.


(c) Financial statement; access to documentsA guarantee of a loan to any enterprise shall not be made under this chapter unless—(1) the Board has received an audited financial statement of the enterprise; and

(2) the enterprise permits the Board to have the same access to its books and other documents as the Board would have under section 1846 of this title in the event the loan is guaranteed.


(d) Exhaustion of remediesNo payment shall be made or become due under a guarantee entered into under this chapter unless the lender has exhausted any remedies which it may have under the guarantee agreement.
