Editorial Notes

References in TextThis chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “This Act” meaning the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, act June 6, 1934, ch. 404. The act was divided into two titles as follows: “Title I—Regulation of Securities Exchanges”
 and “Title II—Amendments to Securities Act of 1933.” This section was section 1 of title I of the Act, which title, as amended, is set out as sections 78a to 78d–5, 78e to 78l, 78m, 78m–1, 78n to 78o, 78o–3, 78o–4, 78o–5 to 78o–7, 78o–10 to 78u–6, 78v to 78dd–1, 78ee to 78hh, 78mm, and 78pp to 78rr of this title. Sections 78kk, 78ll, 78nn, 78oo, and 78rr of this title, which were directed to be added at the end of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, have been treated in the Code as added to title I of the Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress. See Codification notes set out under those sections. Title II of the act amended or repealed sections 77b, 77c, 77d, 77e, 77j, 77k, 77m, 77o, and 77s of this title, and added former sections 78ii and 78jj of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.
