For the purposes of this paragraph, any new company organized as part of the reorganization shall be deemed the same company as its predecessor; and beneficial ownership shall be determined in the manner provided in section 80a–3(c)(1) of this title.

(2) Any issuer as to which there is outstanding a writing filed with the Commission by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation stating that exemption of such issuer from the provisions of this subchapter is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors and is necessary or appropriate by reason of the fact that such issuer holds or proposes to acquire any assets or any product of any assets which have been segregated (A) from assets of any company which at the filing of such writing is an insured institution within the meaning of section 1724(a) 11 See References in Text note below. of title 12, or (B)</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_80a_6_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Exemption of specified investment companies</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Exemption of specified investment companies The following investment companies are exempt from the provisions of this subchapter:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_80a_6_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Exemption of employees’ security company upon application; matters considered</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Exemption of employees’ security company upon application; matters considered Upon application by any employees’ security company, the Commission shall by order exempt such company from the provisions of this subchapter and of the rules and regulations hereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is consistent with the protection of investors.
