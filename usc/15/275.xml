Editorial Notes
Codification
August 9, 2022, referred to in subsec. (c), was in the original “the date of the enactment of this section”, which was translated as meaning the date of enactment of Pub. L. 117–167, which amended this section generally, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

Amendments2022—Pub. L. 117–167 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: “The officers and employees of the Institute, except the director, shall be appointed by the Secretary of Commerce at such time as their respective services may become necessary.”
1988—Pub. L. 100–418 substituted “Institute” for “bureau”.
