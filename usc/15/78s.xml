Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of self-regulatory organizations(a) Registration procedures; notice of filing; other regulatory agencies(1) The Commission shall, upon the filing of an application for registration as a national securities exchange, registered securities association, or registered clearing agency, pursuant to section 78f, 78o–3, or 78q–1 of this title, respectively, publish notice of such filing and afford interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning such application. Within ninety days of the date of publication of such notice (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall—(A) by order grant such registration, or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred eighty days of the date of a publication of notice of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission may extend the time for conclusion of such proceedings for up to ninety days if it finds good cause for such extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the applicant consents.


The Commission shall grant such registration if it finds that the requirements of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the applicant are satisfied. The Commission shall deny such registration if it does not make such finding.

(2) With respect to an application for registration filed by a clearing agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency—(A) The Commission shall not grant registration prior to the sixtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing of such application unless the appropriate reg</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Registration procedures; notice of filing; other regulatory agencies</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Registration procedures; notice of filing; other regulatory agencies</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Proposed rule changes; notice; proceedings</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Proposed rule changes; notice; proceedings</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Amendment by Commission of rules of self-regulatory organizations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Amendment by Commission of rules of self-regulatory organizations The Commission, by rule, may abrogate, add to, and delete from (hereinafter in this subsection collectively referred to as “amend”) the rules of a self-regulatory organization (other than a registered clearing agency) as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate to insure the fair administration of the self-regulatory organization, to conform its rules to requirements of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such organization, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, in the following manner:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Notice of disciplinary action taken by self-regulatory organization against a member or participant; review of action by appropriate regulatory agency; procedure</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Notice of disciplinary action taken by self-regulatory organization against a member or participant; review of action by appropriate regulatory agency; procedure</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Disposition of review; cancellation, reduction, or remission of sanction</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Disposition of review; cancellation, reduction, or remission of sanction</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Dismissal of review proceeding</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Dismissal of review proceeding In any proceeding to review the denial of membership or participation in a self-regulatory organization to any applicant, the barring of any person from becoming associated with a member of a self-regulatory organization, or the prohibition or limitation by a self-regulatory organization of any person with respect to access to services offered by the self-regulatory organization or any member thereof, if the appropriate regulatory agency for such applicant or person, after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of consideration of the record before the self-regulatory organization and opportunity for the presentation of supporting reasons to dismiss the proceeding or set aside the action of the self-regulatory organization) finds that the specific grounds on which such denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation is based exist in fact, that such denial, bar, or prohibition or limitation is in accordance with the rules of th</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Compliance with rules and regulations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Compliance with rules and regulations</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_h"><akn:num>(h)</akn:num><akn:heading>Suspension or revocation of self-regulatory organization’s registration; censure; other sanctions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(h) Suspension or revocation of self-regulatory organization’s registration; censure; other sanctions</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_78s_i"><akn:num>(i)</akn:num><akn:heading>Appointment of trustee</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(i) Appointment of trustee If a proceeding under subsection (h)(1) of this section results in the suspension or revocation of the registration of a clearing agency, the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency may, upon notice to such clearing agency, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction specified in section 78u(d) or 78aa of this title for the appointment of a trustee.
