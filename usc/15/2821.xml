Definitions
As used in this subchapter:(1) The term “octane rating” means the rating of the antiknock characteristics of a grade or type of automotive fuel as determined by dividing by 2 the sum of the research octane number plus the motor octane number, unless another procedure is prescribed under section 2823(c)(3) of this title, in which case such term means the rating of such characteristics as determined under the procedure so prescribed.

(2) The terms “research octane number” and “motor octane number” have the meanings given such terms in the specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) entitled “Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel” designated D4814 (as in effect on June 19, 1978) and, with respect to any grade or type of automotive gasoline, are determined in accordance with test methods set forth in ASTM standard test methods designated D 2699 and D 2700 (as in effect on such date).

(3) The term “knock” means the combustion of a fuel spontaneously in localized areas of a cylinder of a spark-ignition engine, instead of the combustion of such fuel progressing from the spark.

(4) The term “automotive fuel retailer” means any person who markets automotive fuel to the general public for ultimate consumption.

(5) The term “refiner” means any person engaged in the production or importation of automotive fuel.

(6) The term “automotive fuel” means liquid fuel of a type distributed for use as a fuel in any motor vehicle.

(7) The term “motor vehicle” means any self-propelled four-wheeled vehicle, of less than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, which is designed primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways.

(8) The term “new motor vehicle” means any motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has not previously been transferred to an ultimate purchaser.

(9) The term “ultimate purchaser” means, with respect to any item, the first person who purchases such item for purposes other t</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) The term “octane rating” means the rating of the antiknock characteristics of a grade or type of automotive fuel as determined by dividing by 2 the sum of the research octane number plus the motor octane number, unless another procedure is prescribed under section 2823(c)(3) of this title, in which case such term means the rating of such characteristics as determined under the procedure so prescribed.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) The terms “research octane number” and “motor octane number” have the meanings given such terms in the specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) entitled “Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel” designated D4814 (as in effect on June 19, 1978) and, with respect to any grade or type of automotive gasoline, are determined in accordance with test methods set forth in ASTM standard test methods designated D 2699 and D 2700 (as in effect on such date).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) The term “knock” means the combustion of a fuel spontaneously in localized areas of a cylinder of a spark-ignition engine, instead of the combustion of such fuel progressing from the spark.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) The term “automotive fuel retailer” means any person who markets automotive fuel to the general public for ultimate consumption.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) The term “refiner” means any person engaged in the production or importation of automotive fuel.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) The term “automotive fuel” means liquid fuel of a type distributed for use as a fuel in any motor vehicle.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(7) The term “motor vehicle” means any self-propelled four-wheeled vehicle, of less than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, which is designed primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(8) The term “new motor vehicle” means any motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has not previously been transferred to an ultimate purchaser.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_9"><akn:num>(9)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(9) The term “ultimate purchaser” means, with respect to any item, the first person who purchases such item for purposes other than resale.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2821_10"><akn:num>(10)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(10) The term “manufacturer” means any person who imports, manufactures, or assembles motor vehicles for sale.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
