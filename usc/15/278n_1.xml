Emergency communication and tracking technologies research initiative(a) EstablishmentThe Director shall establish a research initiative to support the development of emergency communication and tracking technologies for use in locating trapped individuals in confined spaces, such as underground mines, and other shielded environments, such as high-rise buildings or collapsed structures, where conventional radio communication is limited.


(b) ActivitiesIn order to carry out this section, the Director shall work with the private sector and appropriate Federal agencies to—(1) perform a needs assessment to identify and evaluate the measurement, technical standards, and conformity assessment needs required to improve the operation and reliability of such emergency communication and tracking technologies;

(2) support the development of technical standards and conformance architecture to improve the operation and reliability of such emergency communication and tracking technologies; and

(3) incorporate and build upon existing reports and studies on improving emergency communications.


(c) ReportNot later than 18 months after January 4, 2011, the Director shall submit to Congress and make publicly available a report describing the assessment performed under subsection (b)(1) and making recommendations about research priorities to address gaps in the measurement, technical standards, and conformity assessment needs identified by the assessment.
