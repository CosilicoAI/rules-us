Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs(a) Findings and purposes(1) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(A) For over 50 years, most United States medical school seniors and the large majority of graduate medical education programs (popularly known as “residency programs”) have chosen to use a matching program to match medical students with residency programs to which they have applied. These matching programs have been an integral part of an educational system that has produced the finest physicians and medical researchers in the world.

(B) Before such matching programs were instituted, medical students often felt pressure, at an unreasonably early stage of their medical education, to seek admission to, and accept offers from, residency programs. As a result, medical students often made binding commitments before they were in a position to make an informed decision about a medical specialty or a residency program and before residency programs could make an informed assessment of students’ qualifications. This situation was inefficient, chaotic, and unfair and it often led to placements that did not serve the interests of either medical students or residency programs.

(C) The original matching program, now operated by the independent non-profit National Resident Matching Program and popularly known as “the Match”, was developed and implemented more than 50 years ago in response to widespread student complaints about the prior process. This Program includes on its board of directors individuals nominated by medical student organizations as well as by major medical education and hospital associations.

(D) The Match uses a computerized mathematical algorithm, as students had recommended, to analyze the preferences of students and residency programs and match students with their highest preferences from among the available positions in residency programs that listed them. Students thus obtain a residency positio</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_37b_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Findings and purposes</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Findings and purposes</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_37b_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Application of antitrust laws to graduate medical education residency matching programs</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Application of antitrust laws to graduate medical education residency matching programs</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_37b_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Effective date</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Effective date This section shall take effect on April 10, 2004, shall apply to conduct whether it occurs prior to, on, or after April 10, 2004, and shall apply to all judicial and administrative actions or other proceedings pending on April 10, 2004.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
