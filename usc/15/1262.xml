Declaration of hazardous substances(a) Rulemaking(1) In generalWhenever in the judgment of the Commission such action will promote the objectives of this chapter by avoiding or resolving uncertainty as to its application, the Commission may by regulation declare to be a hazardous substance, for the purposes of this chapter, any substance or mixture of substances, which it finds meets the requirements of section 1261(f)(1)(A) of this title.


(2) ProcedureProceedings for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of regulations under this subsection and the admissibility of the record of such proceedings in other proceedings, shall be governed by the provisions of subsections (f) through (i) of this section.



(b) Reasonable variations or additional label requirementsIf the Commission finds that the requirements of section 1261(p)(1) of this title are not adequate for the protection of the public health and safety in view of the special hazard presented by any particular hazardous substance, it may by regulation establish such reasonable variations or additional label requirements as it finds necessary for the protection of the public health and safety; and any such hazardous substance intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household or by children, which fails to bear a label in accordance with such regulations shall be deemed to be a misbranded hazardous substance.


(c) Exemption from requirements by regulationIf the Commission finds that, because of the size of the package involved or because of the minor hazard presented by the substance contained therein, or for other good and sufficient reasons, full compliance with the labeling requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter is impracticable or is not necessary for the adequate protection of the public health and safety, the Commission shall promulgate regulations exempting such substance from these requirements to the extent it determines to be consistent with adequate protection of t</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1262_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Rulemaking</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Rulemaking</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1262_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Reasonable variations or additional label requirements</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Reasonable variations or additional label requirements If the Commission finds that the requirements of section 1261(p)(1) of this title are not adequate for the protection of the public health and safety in view of the special hazard presented by any particular hazardous substance, it may by regulation establish such reasonable variations or additional label requirements as it finds necessary for the protection of the public health and safety;
