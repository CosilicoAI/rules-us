Interim cellulose insulation safety standard(a) Applicability of specification of General Services Administration; authority and effect of interim standard; modifications; criteria; labeling requirements(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), on and after the last day of the 60-day period beginning on July 11, 1978, the requirements for flame resistance and corrosiveness set forth in the General Services Administration’s specification for cellulose insulation, HH–I–515C (as such specification was in effect on February 1, 1978), shall be deemed to be an interim consumer product safety standard which shall have all the authority and effect of any other consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission under this chapter. During the 45-day period beginning on July 11, 1978, the Commission may make, and shall publish in the Federal Register, such technical, nonsubstantive changes in such requirements as it deems appropriate to make such requirements suitable for promulgation as a consumer product safety standard. At the end of the 60-day period specified in the first sentence of this paragraph, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register such interim consumer product safety standard, as altered by the Commission under this paragraph.

(2) The interim consumer product safety standard established in paragraph (1) shall provide that any cellulose insulation which is produced or distributed for sale or use as a consumer product shall have a flame spread rating of 0 to 25, as such rating is set forth in the General Services Administration’s specification for cellulose insulation, HH–I–515C.

(3) During the period for which the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a) is in effect, in addition to complying with any labeling requirement established by the Commission under this chapter, each manufacturer or private labeler of cellulose insulation shall include the following statement on any container of such ce</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2082_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Applicability of specification of General Services Administration; authority and effect of interim standard; modifications; criteria; labeling requirements</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Applicability of specification of General Services Administration; authority and effect of interim standard; modifications; criteria; labeling requirements</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2082_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Scope of judicial review</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Scope of judicial review Judicial review of the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a), as such standard is in effect on and after the last day of the 60-day period specified in such subsection, shall be limited solely to the issue of whether any changes made by the Commission under paragraph (1) are technical, nonsubstantive changes. For purposes of such review, any change made by the Commission under paragraph (1) which requires that any test to determine the flame spread rating of cellulose insulation shall include a correction for variations in test results caused by equipment used in the test shall be considered a technical, nonsubstantive change.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2082_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Enforcement; violations; promulgation of final standard; procedures applicable to promulgation; revision of interim standard; procedures applicable to revision</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Enforcement; violations; promulgation of final standard; procedures applicable to promulgation; revision of interim standard; procedures applicable to revision</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2082_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Reporting requirements of other Federal departments, agencies, etc., of violations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Reporting requirements of other Federal departments, agencies, etc., of violations Any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality, or any Federal independent regulatory agency, which obtains information which reasonably indicates that cellulose insulation is being manufactured or distributed in violation of this chapter shall immediately inform the Commission of such information.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2082_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Reporting requirements of Commission to Congressional committees; contents, time of submission, etc.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Reporting requirements of Commission to Congressional committees; contents, time of submission, etc.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2082_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Compliance with certification requirements; implementation; waiver; rules and regulations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Compliance with certification requirements; implementation; waiver; rules and regulations</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2082_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Authorization of appropriations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Authorization of appropriations There are authorized to be appropriated, for each of the fiscal years 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981, such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
