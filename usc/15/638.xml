Research and development(a) Declaration of policyResearch and development are major factors in the growth and progress of industry and the national economy. The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.


(b) Assistance to small-business concernsIt shall be the duty of the Administration, and it is empowered—(1) to assist small-business concerns to obtain Government contracts for research and development;

(2) to assist small-business concerns to obtain the benefits of research and development performed under Government contracts or at Government expense;

(3) to provide technical assistance to small-business concerns to accomplish the purposes of this section;

(4) to develop and maintain a source file and an information program to assure each qualified and interested small business concern the opportunity to participate in Federal agency small business innovation research programs and small business technology transfer programs;

(5) to coordinate with participating agencies a schedule for release of SBIR and STTR solicitations, and to prepare a master release schedule so as to maximize small businesses’ opportunities to respond to solicitations;

(6) to independently survey and monitor the operation of SBIR and STTR programs within participating Federal agencies;
