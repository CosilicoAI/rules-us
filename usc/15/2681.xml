Definitions
For the purposes of this subchapter:(1) AbatementThe term “abatement” means any set of measures designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards in accordance with standards established by the Administrator under this subchapter. Such term includes—(A) the removal of lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust, the permanent containment or encapsulation of lead-based paint, the replacement of lead-painted surfaces or fixtures, and the removal or covering of lead-contaminated soil; and

(B) all preparation, cleanup, disposal, and postabatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures.


(2) Accessible surfaceThe term “accessible surface” means an interior or exterior surface painted with lead-based paint that is accessible for a young child to mouth or chew.


(3) Deteriorated paintThe term “deteriorated paint” means any interior or exterior paint that is peeling, chipping, chalking or cracking or any paint located on an interior or exterior surface or fixture that is damaged or deteriorated.


(4) EvaluationThe term “evaluation” means risk assessment, inspection, or risk assessment and inspection.


(5) Friction surfaceThe term “friction surface” means an interior or exterior surface that is subject to abrasion or friction, including certain window, floor, and stair surfaces.


(6) Impact surfaceThe term “impact surface” means an interior or exterior surface that is subject to damage by repeated impacts, for example, certain parts of door frames.


(7) InspectionThe term “inspection” means (A) a surface-by-surface investigation to determine the presence of lead-based paint, as provided in section 4822(c) of title 42, and (B) the provision of a report explaining the results of the investigation.


(8) Interim controlsThe term “interim controls” means a set of measures designed to reduce temporarily human exposure or likely exposure to lead-based paint hazards, including specialized cleaning, repairs, maintenance, painti</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2681_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:heading>Abatement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(1) Abatement The term “abatement” means any set of measures designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards in accordance with standards established by the Administrator under this subchapter.
