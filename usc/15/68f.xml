Exclusion of misbranded wool products
All wool products imported into the United States, except those made more than twenty years prior to such importation, shall be stamped, tagged, labeled, or otherwise identified in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter and all invoices of such wool products required under the Act of June 17, 1930 (c. 497, title IV, 46 Stat. 719), shall set forth, in addition to the matter therein specified, the information with respect to said wool products required under the provisions of this subchapter, which information shall be in the invoices prior to their certification under said Act of June 17, 1930.
The falsification of, or failure to set forth, said information in said invoices, or the falsification or perjury of the consignee’s declaration provided for in said Act of June 17, 1930, insofar as it relates to said information, shall be an unfair method of competition, and an unfair and deceptive act, or practice, in commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act; and any person who falsifies, or fails to set forth, said information in said invoices, or who falsifies or perjures said consignee’s declaration insofar as it relates to said information, may thenceforth be prohibited by the Commission from importing, or participating in the importation of, any wool products into the United States except upon filing bond with the Secretary of the Treasury in a sum double the value of said wool products and any duty thereon, conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.
A verified statement from the manufacturer or producer of such wool products showing their fiber content as required under the provisions of this subchapter may be required under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
