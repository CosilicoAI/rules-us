Examinations and audits
The Director shall from time to time, at least annually, require examinations and reports of condition of all Federal Home Loan Banks in such form as the Director shall prescribe and shall furnish periodically statements based upon the reports of the banks to the Director. For the purposes of this chapter, examiners appointed by the Director shall be subject to the same requirements, responsibilities, and penalties as are applicable to examiners under the National Bank Act [12 U.S.C. 21 et seq.] and the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 221 et seq.], and shall have, in the exercise of functions under this chapter, the same powers and privileges as are vested in such examiners by law. In addition to such examinations, the Comptroller General may audit or examine the Director and the Banks, to determine the extent to which the Director and the Banks are fairly and effectively fulfilling the purposes of this chapter.
