National Institute of Building Sciences(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose(1) The Congress finds (A) that the lack of an authoritative national source to make findings and to advise both the public and private sectors of the economy with respect to the use of building science and technology in achieving nationally acceptable standards and other technical provision for use in Federal, State, and local housing and building regulations is an obstacle to efforts by and imposes severe burdens upon all those who procure, design, construct, use, operate, maintain, and retire physical facilities, and frequently results in the failure to take full advantage of new and useful developments in technology which could improve our living environment; (B) that the establishment of model buildings codes or of a single national building code will not completely resolve the problem because of the difficulty at all levels of government in updating their housing and building regulations to reflect new developments in technology, as well as the irregularities and inconsistencies which arise in applying such requirements to particular localities or special local conditions; (C) that the lack of uniform housing and building regulatory provisions increases the costs of construction and thereby reduces the amount of housing and other community facilities which can be provided; and (D) that the existence of a single authoritative nationally recognized institution to provide for the evaluation of new technology could facilitate introduction of such innovations and their acceptance at the Federal, State, and local levels.

(2) The Congress further finds, however, that while an authoritative source of technical findings is needed, various private organizations and institutions, private industry, labor, and Federal and other governmental agencies and entities are presently engaged in building research, technology development, testing, and evaluation, standards and mod</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Establishment; advice and assistance of Academies-Research Council and other agencies and organizations knowledgeable in building technology</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Establishment; advice and assistance of Academies-Research Council and other agencies and organizations knowledgeable in building technology</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Board of Directors; number; appointment; membership; terms of office; vacancies; appointment, etc., of Chairman and Vice Chairman; employees of United States; travel and subsistence expenses; appointment and compensation of president and other executive officers and employees; establishment, membership, and functions of Consultative Council</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Board of Directors; number; appointment; membership; terms of office; vacancies; appointment, etc., of Chairman and Vice Chairman; employees of United States; travel and subsistence expenses; appointment and compensation of president and other executive officers and employees; establishment, membership, and functions of Consultative Council</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Financial restrictions and prohibitions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Financial restrictions and prohibitions</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Exercise of functions and responsibilities</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Exercise of functions and responsibilities</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Contract and grant authorization; donations; fees; amounts received in addition to amounts appropriated</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Contract and grant authorization; donations; fees; amounts received in addition to amounts appropriated</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Technical findings and performance criteria and standards; applicability and use by Federal departments, agencies, and establishments, and State and local governments; supporting grants and contracts</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Technical findings and performance criteria and standards; applicability and use by Federal departments, agencies, and establishments, and State and local governments; supporting grants and contracts</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_h"><akn:num>(h)</akn:num><akn:heading>Advanced Building Technology Program</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(h) Advanced Building Technology Program</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1701j_2_i"><akn:num>(i)</akn:num><akn:heading>Authorization of appropriations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(i) Authorization of appropriations There is authorized to be appropriated to the Institute not to exceed $5,000,000 for the fiscal year 1975, and $5,000,000 for the fiscal year 1976, and $5,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1977 and 1978, and any amounts not appropriated in fiscal years 1977 and 1978 may be appropriated in any fiscal year through 1984 (with not more than $500,000 to be appropriated for each of the fiscal years 1982, 1983, and 1984 and with each appropriation to be available until expended), to provide the Institute with initial capital adequate for the exercise of its functions and responsibilities during such years; and thereafter the Institute shall be financially self-sustaining through the means described in subsection (f).
