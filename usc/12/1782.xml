Administration of insurance fund(a) Reports of condition(1) Each insured credit union shall make reports of condition to the Board upon dates which shall be selected by it. Such reports of condition shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Board may require. The reporting dates selected for reports of condition shall be the same for all insured credit unions except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any credit union the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. The total amount of the member accounts of each insured credit union as of each reporting date shall be reported in such reports of condition in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board. Each report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, by a vice president, by the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors of the reporting credit union to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of such officer’s knowledge and belief. Unless such requirement is waived by the Board, the correctness of each report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of three of the officers of the reporting credit union with the declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct.

(2) The Board may call for such other reports as it may from time to time require.

(3) The Board may require reports of condition to be published in such manner, not inconsistent with any applicable law, as it may direct. Any insured credit union which maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any inadvertent error and, unintentionally and as a result of such an error, fails to submit or publish any report required under this subsection or section 1756 of this title, within the period of time specified by the Board, or submits or publishes any false or misleading report or information, or inadvertently transmits or publish</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1782_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Reports of condition</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Reports of condition</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1782_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Certified statement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Certified statement</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1782_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Deposit with National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund; amount, return, distribution, etc.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Deposit with National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund; amount, return, distribution, etc.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1782_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Remedy for failure to report; penalty for failure to file certified statement or pay premium; dispute as to deposit or premium charge; prohibition on distribution of assets or dividends while in default</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Remedy for failure to report; penalty for failure to file certified statement or pay premium; dispute as to deposit or premium charge; prohibition on distribution of assets or dividends while in default</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1782_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Recovery of unpaid deposit or premium; limitations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Recovery of unpaid deposit or premium; limitations The Board, in a suit brought at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be entitled to recover from any insured credit union the amount of any unpaid deposit or premium charge for insurance lawfully payable by the credit union to the fund, whether or not such credit union shall have made any report of condition under subsection (a) of this section or filed any certified statement required under subsection (b) of this section and whether or not suit shall have been brought to compel the credit union to make any such report or to file any such statement. No action or proceeding shall be brought for the recovery of any deposit or premium charge due to the fund, or for the recovery of any amount paid to the fund in excess of the amount due it, unless such action or proceeding shall have been brought within five years after the right accrued for which the claim is made.
