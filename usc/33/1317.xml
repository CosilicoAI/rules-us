Toxic and pretreatment effluent standards(a) Toxic pollutant list; revision; hearing; promulgation of standards; effective date; consultation(1) On and after December 27, 1977, the list of toxic pollutants or combination of pollutants subject to this chapter shall consist of those toxic pollutants listed in table 1 of Committee Print Numbered 95–30 of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives, and the Administrator shall publish, not later than the thirtieth day after December 27, 1977, that list. From time to time thereafter, the Administrator may revise such list and the Administrator is authorized to add to or remove from such list any pollutant. The Administrator in publishing any revised list, including the addition or removal of any pollutant from such list, shall take into account toxicity of the pollutant, its persistence, degradability, the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms in any waters, the importance of the affected organisms, and the nature and extent of the effect of the toxic pollutant on such organisms. A determination of the Administrator under this paragraph shall be final except that if, on judicial review, such determination was based on arbitrary and capricious action of the Administrator, the Administrator shall make a redetermination.

(2) Each toxic pollutant listed in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be subject to effluent limitations resulting from the application of the best available technology economically achievable for the applicable category or class of point sources established in accordance with sections 1311(b)(2)(A) and 1314(b)(2) of this title. The Administrator, in his discretion, may publish in the Federal Register a proposed effluent standard (which may include a prohibition) establishing requirements for a toxic pollutant which, if an effluent limitation is applicable to a class or category of point sources, shall be applicable to such ca</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1317_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Toxic pollutant list; revision; hearing; promulgation of standards; effective date; consultation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Toxic pollutant list; revision; hearing; promulgation of standards; effective date; consultation</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1317_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Pretreatment standards; hearing; promulgation; compliance period; revision; application to State and local laws</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Pretreatment standards; hearing; promulgation; compliance period; revision; application to State and local laws</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1317_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>New sources of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) New sources of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works In order to insure that any source introducing pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works, which source would be a new source subject to section 1316 of this title if it were to discharge pollutants, will not cause a violation of the effluent limitations established for any such treatment works, the Administrator shall promulgate pretreatment standards for the category of such sources simultaneously with the promulgation of standards of performance under section 1316 of this title for the equivalent category of new sources.
