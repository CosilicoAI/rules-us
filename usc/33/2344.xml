Safety assurance review(a) Projects subject to safety assurance reviewThe Chief of Engineers shall ensure that the design and construction activities for hurricane and storm damage reduction and flood damage reduction projects are reviewed by independent experts under this section if the Chief of Engineers determines that a review by independent experts is necessary to assure public health, safety, and welfare.


(b) FactorsIn determining whether a review of design and construction of a project is necessary under this section, the Chief of Engineers shall consider whether—(1) the failure of the project would pose a significant threat to human life;

(2) the project involves the use of innovative materials or techniques;

(3) the project design lacks redundancy; or

(4) the project has a unique construction sequencing or a reduced or overlapping design construction schedule.


(c) Safety assurance review(1) Initiation of reviewAt the appropriate point in the development of detailed engineering and design specifications for each water resources project subject to review under this section, the Chief of Engineers shall initiate a safety assurance review by independent experts on the design and construction activities for the project.


(2) Selection of reviewersA safety assurance review under this section shall include participation by experts selected by the Chief of Engineers from among individuals who are distinguished experts in engineering, hydrology, or other appropriate disciplines. The Chief of Engineers shall apply the National Academy of Science’s policy for selecting reviewers to ensure that reviewers have no conflict of interest with the project being reviewed.


(3) CompensationAn individual serving as an independent reviewer under this section shall be compensated at a rate of pay to be determined by the Secretary and shall be allowed travel expenses.
