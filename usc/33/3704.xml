Strategic research plan(a) In generalNot later than 2 years after March 30, 2009, and not later than every 5 years following the publication of each subsequent strategic research plan until 2035, the Subcommittee shall develop a strategic plan for Federal research and monitoring on ocean acidification and coastal acidification that will provide for an assessment of the impacts of ocean acidification and coastal acidification on marine organisms and ecosystems and the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to address the socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification and coastal acidification and to conserve marine organisms and ecosystems. In developing the plan, the Subcommittee shall consider and use information, reports, and studies of ocean acidification and coastal acidification that have identified research and monitoring needed to better understand ocean acidification and coastal acidification and its potential impacts, and recommendations made by the Advisory Board established in section 3703(c) of this title.


(b) Contents of the planThe plan shall—(1) provide for interdisciplinary research among the ocean sciences and social sciences, and coordinated research and activities to improve the understanding of ocean chemistry that will affect marine ecosystems;

(2) establish, for the 10-year period beginning in the year the plan is submitted, the goals and priorities for Federal research and monitoring which will—(A) advance understanding of ocean acidification and its physical, chemical, and biological impacts on marine organisms and marine ecosystems;

(B) assess the short-term and long-term socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification;

(C) provide information for the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to address—(i) socioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification and coastal acidification;

(ii) conservation of marine organisms and ecosystems;
