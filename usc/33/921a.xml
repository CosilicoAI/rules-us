Editorial Notes

References in TextThis Act, referred to in text, probably should have been a reference to act Mar. 4, 1927, ch. 509, 44 Stat. 1424, known as the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, which is classified generally to this chapter. This section was not enacted as part of that Act, see Codification note below. For complete classification of act Mar. 4, 1927, to the Code, see section 901 of this title and Tables.

Codification
Section was not enacted as part of the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act which comprises this chapter.

Amendments1972—Pub. L. 92–576, which directed the general amendment of “[s]ection 21a of the Act”, meaning section 21a of act Mar. 4, 1927, was executed to this section, which is act May 4, 1928, ch. 502, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Act Mar. 4, 1927, does not contain a section 21a. Prior to amendment, section required the United States attorney in the judicial district in which a case was pending to appear as attorney or counsel on behalf of the Secretary of Labor or his deputy commissioner when either was a party to the case or interested, and to represent such Secretary or deputy in any court in which such case could be carried on appeal.
