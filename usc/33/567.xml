And said States, or any two of them, may agree with each other upon any project or projects for the purpose of making such improvements, and upon the amount of money to be contributed by each to carry out such projects. The Secretary of the Army is authorized and directed to make a survey of any project proposed, as aforesaid, by said States, or any two of them, to determine the feasibility and practicability thereof and the expenses of carrying the same into effect and what share of such expenses should be borne by the respective States, local interests, or by the National Government.
