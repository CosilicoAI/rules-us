Workforce study(a) In generalThe Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, in cooperation with the Secretary of Education, shall request the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the scientific workforce in the areas of oceanic and atmospheric research and development. The study shall investigate—(1) whether there is a shortage in the number of individuals with advanced degrees in oceanic and atmospheric sciences who have the ability to conduct high quality scientific research in physical and chemical oceanography, meteorology, and atmospheric modeling, and related fields, for government, nonprofit, and private sector entities;

(2) whether there is a shortage in the number of individuals with technical or trade-based degrees, skillsets, or credentials suited to a career in oceanic and atmospheric data collection, processing, satellite production, or satellite operations;

(3) what Federal programs are available to help facilitate the education of students hoping to pursue these degrees, skillsets, or credentials;

(4) barriers to transitioning highly qualified oceanic and atmospheric scientists or highly qualified technical professionals and tradespeople into Federal civil service scientist career tracks;

(5) what institutions of higher education, the private sector, and the Congress could do to increase the number of individuals with such post baccalaureate degrees, skillsets, or credentials;

(6) the impact of an aging Federal workforce on the ability of Federal agencies to conduct high quality scientific research, observations, and monitoring;

(7) what actions the Federal government can take to assist the transition of highly qualified scientists, technical professionals, and tradespeople into Federal career positions;

(8) workforce diversity and actions the Federal Government can take to increase diversity in the scientific workforce; and
