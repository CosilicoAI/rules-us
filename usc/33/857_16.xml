Editorial Notes

References in TextSection 5703 of title 5, referred to in text, was amended generally by Pub. L. 94–22, § 4, May 19, 1975, 89 Stat. 85, and, as so amended, does not contain a subsec. (b).

Prior ProvisionsA provision similar to that contained in this section, which authorized compensation and travel expenses for members of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere as originally established on Aug. 16, 1971, was contained in section 857–10 of this title prior to repeal by section 7(a) of Pub. L. 95–63.

Amendments1981—Pub. L. 97–87 substituted “not to exceed the daily rate for a GS–18” for “of $100 per day”.
