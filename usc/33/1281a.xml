Total treatment system funding
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case where the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency finds that the total of all grants made under section 201 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1281] for the same treatment works exceeds the actual construction costs for such treatment works (as defined in that Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.]) such excess amount shall be a grant of the Federal share (as defined in that Act) of the cost of construction of a sewage collection system if—(1) such sewage collection system was constructed as part of the same total treatment system as the treatment works for which such section 201 [33 U.S.C. 1281] grants were approved, and

(2) an application for assistance for the construction of such sewage collection system was filed in accordance with section 3102 of title 42 before all such section 201 grants were made and such grant under section 3102 of title 42 could not be approved due to lack of funding under such section 3102 of title 42.


The total of all grants for sewage collection systems made under this section shall not exceed $2,800,000.
(Pub. L. 95–217, § 78, Dec. 27, 1977, 91 Stat. 1611.)
