Editorial Notes
Codification
Section is from act Aug. 11, 1888, the River and Harbor Appropriation Act of 1888.
In the original text the words “said reservoirs” appeared instead of “reservoirs at the headwaters of the Mississippi river.” The provision from which this section is derived, however, followed an appropriation “for continuing operations upon the reservoirs at the headwaters of the Mississippi river.”
