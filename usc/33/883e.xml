Editorial Notes
Amendments2000—Par. (1). Pub. L. 106–181, § 605(b)(1), substituted “cooperative agreements, or any other agreements,” for “cooperative agreements”.
Par. (2). Pub. L. 106–181, § 605(b)(2), which directed the striking of “cooperative”, was executed by striking “cooperative” before “agreement” in two places, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
1986—Pub. L. 99–272 designated existing provisions as par. (1), inserted “any Federal agency,” after “or subdivision thereof,” and added par. (2).
