(b) Study of physical hydraulic modelIn addition, the Secretary shall study a proper physical hydraulic model of the New York Bight and for such an offshore model to be tied into the existing inshore physical hydraulic model of the Port of New York and New Jersey operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.


(c) Agency coordination; findings and recommendationsThe Secretary shall coordinate fully with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in carrying out the study described in this section and shall report any findings and recommendations to Congress.
