Congressional findings
The Congress finds and declares that—(a) extraction of coal and other minerals from the earth can be accomplished by various methods of mining, including surface mining;

(b) coal mining operations presently contribute significantly to the Nation’s energy requirements; surface coal mining constitutes one method of extraction of the resource; the overwhelming percentage of the Nation’s coal reserves can only be extracted by underground mining methods, and it is, therefore, essential to the national interest to insure the existence of an expanding and economically healthy underground coal mining industry;

(c) many surface mining operations result in disturbances of surface areas that burden and adversely affect commerce and the public welfare by destroying or diminishing the utility of land for commercial, industrial, residential, recreational, agricultural, and forestry purposes, by causing erosion and landslides, by contributing to floods, by polluting the water, by destroying fish and wildlife habitats, by impairing natural beauty, by damaging the property of citizens, by creating hazards dangerous to life and property by degrading the quality of life in local communities, and by counteracting governmental programs and efforts to conserve soil, water, and other natural resources;

(d) the expansion of coal mining to meet the Nation’s energy needs makes even more urgent the establishment of appropriate standards to minimize damage to the environment and to productivity of the soil and to protect the health and safety of the public.11 So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon.

(e) surface mining and reclamation technology are now developed so that effective and reasonable regulation of surface coal mining operations by the States and by the Federal Government in accordance with the requirements of this chapter is an appropriate and necessary means to minimize so far as practicable the adverse social, economic, and envi</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1201_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) extraction of coal and other minerals from the earth can be accomplished by various methods of mining, including surface mining;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1201_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(b) coal mining operations presently contribute significantly to the Nation’s energy requirements; surface coal mining constitutes one method of extraction of the resource; the overwhelming percentage of the Nation’s coal reserves can only be extracted by underground mining methods, and it is, therefore, essential to the national interest to insure the existence of an expanding and economically healthy underground coal mining industry;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1201_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(c) many surface mining operations result in disturbances of surface areas that burden and adversely affect commerce and the public welfare by destroying or diminishing the utility of land for commercial, industrial, residential, recreational, agricultural, and forestry purposes, by causing erosion and landslides, by contributing to floods, by polluting the water, by destroying fish and wildlife habitats, by impairing natural beauty, by damaging the property of citizens, by creating hazards dangerous to life and property by degrading the quality of life in local communities, and by counteracting governmental programs and efforts to conserve soil, water, and other natural resources;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1201_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(d) the expansion of coal mining to meet the Nation’s energy needs makes even more urgent the establishment of appropriate standards to minimize damage to the environment and to productivity of the soil and to protect the health and safety of the public.11 So in original.
