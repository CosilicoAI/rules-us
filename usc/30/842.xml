Dust concentration and respiratory equipment(a) Samples; procedures; transmittal; notice of excess concentration; periodic reports to Secretary; contentsEach operator of a coal mine shall take accurate samples of the amount of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere to which each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed. Such samples shall be taken by any device approved by the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services and in accordance with such methods, at such locations, at such intervals, and in such manner as the Secretaries shall prescribe in the Federal Register within sixty days from December 30, 1969 and from time to time thereafter. Such samples shall be transmitted to the Secretary in a manner established by him, and analyzed and recorded by him in a manner that will assure application of the provisions of section 814(i) of this title when the applicable limit on the concentration of respirable dust required to be maintained under this section is exceeded. The results of such samples shall also be made available to the operator. Each operator shall report and certify to the Secretary at such intervals as the Secretary may require as to the conditions in the active workings of the coal mine, including, but not limited to, the average number of working hours worked during each shift, the quantity and velocity of air regularly reaching the working faces, the method of mining, the amount and pressure of the water, if any, reaching the working faces, and the number, location, and type of sprays, if any, used.


(b) Standards; noncompliance permit; renewal; procedures; limitations; extension periodExcept as otherwise provided in this subsection—(1) Effective on the operative date of this subchapter, each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed at or below 3.0 milligrams of respirab</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_842_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Samples; procedures; transmittal; notice of excess concentration; periodic reports to Secretary; contents</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Samples; procedures; transmittal; notice of excess concentration; periodic reports to Secretary; contents Each operator of a coal mine shall take accurate samples of the amount of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere to which each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed.
