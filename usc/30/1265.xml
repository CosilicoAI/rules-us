Environmental protection performance standards(a) Permit requirementAny permit issued under any approved State or Federal program pursuant to this chapter to conduct surface coal mining operations shall require that such surface coal mining operations will meet all applicable performance standards of this chapter, and such other requirements as the regulatory authority shall promulgate.


(b) General standardsGeneral performance standards shall be applicable to all surface coal mining and reclamation operations and shall require the operation as a minimum to—(1) conduct surface coal mining operations so as to maximize the utilization and conservation of the solid fuel resource being recovered so that reaffecting the land in the future through surface coal mining can be minimized;

(2) restore the land affected to a condition capable of supporting the uses which it was capable of supporting prior to any mining, or higher or better uses of which there is reasonable likelihood, so long as such use or uses do not present any actual or probable hazard to public health or safety or pose any actual or probable threat of water diminution or pollution, and the permit applicants’ declared proposed land use following reclamation is not deemed to be impractical or unreasonable, inconsistent with applicable land use policies and plans, involves unreasonable delay in implementation, or is violative of Federal, State, or local law;

(3) except as provided in subsection (c) with respect to all surface coal mining operations backfill, compact (where advisable to insure stability or to prevent leaching of toxic materials), and grade in order to restore the approximate original contour of the land with all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions eliminated (unless small depressions are needed in order to retain moisture to assist revegetation or as otherwise authorized pursuant to this chapter): Provided, however, That in surface coal mining which is carried out at the same lo</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1265_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Permit requirement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Permit requirement Any permit issued under any approved State or Federal program pursuant to this chapter to conduct surface coal mining operations shall require that such surface coal mining operations will meet all applicable performance standards of this chapter, and such other requirements as the regulatory authority shall promulgate.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1265_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>General standards</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) General standards General performance standards shall be applicable to all surface coal mining and reclamation operations and shall require the operation as a minimum to—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1265_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Procedures; exception to original contour restoration requirements</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Procedures; exception to original contour restoration requirements</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1265_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Steep-slope surface coal mining standards</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Steep-slope surface coal mining standards The following performance standards shall be applicable to steep-slope surface coal mining and shall be in addition to those general performance standards required by this section: Provided, however, That the provisions of this subsection (d) shall not apply to those situations in which an operator is mining on flat or gently rolling terrain, on which an occasional steep slope is encountered through which the mining operation is to proceed, leaving a plain or predominantly flat area or where an operator is in compliance with provisions of subsection (c) hereof:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1265_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Variances to original contour restoration requirements</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Variances to original contour restoration requirements</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1265_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Standards and criteria for coal mine waste piles</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Standards and criteria for coal mine waste piles The Secretary, with the written concurrence of the Chief of Engineers, shall establish within one hundred and thirty-five days from August 3, 1977, standards and criteria regulating the design, location, construction, operation, maintenance, enlargement, modification, removal, and abandonment of new and existing coal mine waste piles referred to in subsection (b)(13) and section 1266(b)(5) of this title. Such standards and criteria shall conform to the standards and criteria used by the Chief of Engineers to insure that flood control structures are safe and effectively perform their intended function.
