Hoisting and mantrips(a) Transporting of persons; required equipment and capabilities; safety catches; daily examinations; operatorsEvery hoist used to transport persons at a coal mine shall be equipped with overspeed, overwind, and automatic stop controls. Every hoist handling platforms, cages, or other devices used to transport persons shall be equipped with brakes capable of stopping the fully loaded platform, cage, or other device; with hoisting cable adequately strong to sustain the fully loaded platform, cage, or other device; and have a proper margin of safety. Cages, platforms, or other devices which are used to transport persons in shafts and slopes shall be equipped with safety catches or other no less effective devices approved by the Secretary that act quickly and effectively in an emergency, and such catches shall be tested at least once every two months. Hoisting equipment, including automatic elevators, that is used to transport persons shall be examined daily. Where persons are transported into, or out of, a coal mine by hoists, a qualified hoisting engineer shall be on duty while any person is underground, except that no such engineer shall be required for automatically operated cages, platforms, or elevators.


(b) Promulgation of other safeguardsOther safeguards adequate, in the judgment of an authorized representative of the Secretary, to minimize hazards with respect to transportation of men and materials shall be provided.


(c) Rated capacities; indicator for position of cageHoists shall have rated capacities consistent with the loads handled and the recommended safety factors of the ropes used. An accurate and reliable indicator of the position of the cage, platform, skip, bucket, or cars shall be provided.


(d) Methods for signaling between shaft stations and hoist roomsThere shall be at least two effective methods approved by the Secretary of signaling between each of the shaft stations and the hoist room, one of which shall be a te</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_874_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Transporting of persons; required equipment and capabilities; safety catches; daily examinations; operators</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Transporting of persons; required equipment and capabilities; safety catches; daily examinations; operators Every hoist used to transport persons at a coal mine shall be equipped with overspeed, overwind, and automatic stop controls.
