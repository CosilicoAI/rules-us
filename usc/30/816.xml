A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission and to the other parties, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record in the proceeding as provided in section 2112 of title 28.

No objection that has not been urged before the Commission shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the Commission with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be made a part of the rec</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_816_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Petition by person adversely affected or aggrieved; temporary relief</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Petition by person adversely affected or aggrieved; temporary relief</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_816_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Petition by Secretary for review or enforcement of final Commission orders</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Petition by Secretary for review or enforcement of final Commission orders The Secretary may also obtain review or enforcement of any final order of the Commission by filing a petition for such relief in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the alleged violation occurred or in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the provisions of subsection (a) shall govern such proceedings to the extent applicable.
