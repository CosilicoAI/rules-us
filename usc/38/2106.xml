Veterans’ mortgage life insurance(a) The Secretary shall insure any individual under 70 years of age who has received assistance under this chapter against the death of the individual except for an individual who—(1) elects in writing to not receive insurance under this section;

(2) fails to respond in a timely manner to a request from the Secretary for information on which the premium for such insurance can be based; or

(3) receives such assistance under section 2102B of this title.


(b) The amount of insurance provided an individual under this section may not exceed the lesser of $150,000, or after January 1, 2012, $200,000, or the amount of the loan outstanding on the housing unit. The amount of such insurance shall be reduced according to the amortization schedule of the loan and may not at any time exceed the amount of the outstanding loan with interest. If there is no outstanding loan on the housing unit, insurance is not payable under this section. If an eligible individual elects not to be insured under this section, the individual may thereafter be insured under this section, but only upon submission of an application, payment of required premiums, and compliance with such health requirements and other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary.

(c) The premiums charged an individual for insurance under this section shall be paid at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes. The rates for such premiums shall be based on such mortality data as the Secretary considers appropriate to cover only the mortality cost of insuring standard lives. In the case of an individual receiving compensation or other cash benefits paid to the individual by the Secretary, the Secretary shall deduct from such compensation or other benefits the premiums charged the individual under this section.
