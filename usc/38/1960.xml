In mentally incompetent cases the waiver is to be made without application and retroactive when necessary. Relief from payment of premiums on the due date thereof shall be for full calendar months, beginning with the month in which said confinement to hospital, the temporary total disability rating, or the mental incompetency began or begins and ending with that month during the half or major fraction of which such persons are no longer entitled to waiver as provided above.
