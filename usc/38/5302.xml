Waiver of recovery of claims by the United States(a)(1) There shall be no recovery of payments or overpayments (or any interest thereon) of any benefits under any of the laws administered by the Secretary whenever the Secretary determines that recovery would be against equity and good conscience, if an application for relief is made within one year from the date of notification of the indebtedness by the Secretary to the payee, or within such longer period as the Secretary determines is reasonable in a case in which the payee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such notification was not actually received by such payee within a reasonable period after such date. The Secretary shall include in the notification to the payee a statement of the right of the payee to submit an application for a waiver under this subsection and a description of the procedures for submitting the application.

(2) The Secretary may not seek to recover an indebtedness described in paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that the cost to the Department to recover such indebtedness, as determined when the debt is established, would exceed the amount of the indebtedness.
