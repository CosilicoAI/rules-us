Plans of insurance(a) Regulations shall provide for the right to convert insurance on the five-year level premium term plan into ordinary life, twenty-payment life, endowment maturing at age sixty-two, and into other usual forms of insurance as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Provision shall be made for reconversion of any such policies to a higher premium rate or, upon proof of good health satisfactory to the Secretary, to a lower premium rate, in accordance with regulations to be issued by the Secretary. No reconversion shall be made to a five-year level premium term policy.

(b) An insured who on or after the insured’s sixty-fifth birthday has a five-year level premium term policy of insurance in force by payment of premiums may exchange such policy for insurance on a special endowment at age ninety-six plan upon written application; payment of the required premium; and surrender of the five-year level premium term policy and any total disability provision attached thereto with all rights, title, and interests thereunder. However, if it is found by the Secretary subsequent to the exchange that prior thereto the term policy matured because of total permanent disability of the insured or that the insured was entitled to total disability benefits under the total disability provision attached to such policy, the insured, upon surrender of the special endowment at age ninety-six policy and any provision for waiver of premiums issued under subsection (c) of this section with all rights, title, and interest thereunder, will be entitled to benefits payable under the prior contract. In such case, the cash value less any indebtedness on the endowment policy shall be refunded together with any premiums paid on a provision for waiver of premiums. Insurance on the special endowment at age ninety-six plan shall be issued at the attained age of the insured upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in standard policies of United States Government Life Insur</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1942_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Regulations shall provide for the right to convert insurance on the five-year level premium term plan into ordinary life, twenty-payment life, endowment maturing at age sixty-two, and into other usual forms of insurance as may be prescribed by the Secretary.
