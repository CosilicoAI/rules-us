Basic tables of premiums; readjustment of rates(a) Each policy or policies purchased under section 1966 of this title shall include for the first policy year a schedule of basic premium rates by age which the Secretary shall have determined on a basis consistent with the lowest schedule of basic premium rates generally charged for new group life insurance policies issued to large employers, this schedule of basic premium rates by age to be applied, except as otherwise provided in this section, to the distribution by age of the amount of group life insurance under the policy at its date of issue to determine an average basic premium per $1,000 of insurance. Each policy so purchased shall also include provisions whereby the basic rates of premium determined for the first policy year shall be continued for subsequent policy years, except that they may be readjusted for any subsequent year, based on the experience under the policy, such readjustment to be made by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy on a basis determined by the Secretary in advance of such year to be consistent with the general practice of life insurance companies under policies of group life insurance issued to large employers.

(b) The total premiums for Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance shall be the sum of the amounts computed according to the provisions of subsection (a) above and the estimated cost traceable to the extra hazard of active duty in the uniformed services as determined by the Secretary, subject to the provision that such estimated costs traceable to the extra hazard shall be retroactively readjusted annually in accordance with section 1969(b).
