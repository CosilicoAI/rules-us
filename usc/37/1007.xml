Deductions from pay(a) The pay of an officer of an armed force may be withheld, under section 5512 of title 5, only for an indebtedness to the United States admitted by the officer or shown by the judgment of a court, or upon a special order issued in the discretion of the Secretary of Defense (or the Secretary of Homeland Security, in the case of an officer of the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy), or upon the denial of relief of an officer pursuant to section 3527 of title 31.

(b) An amount due to the United States from an enlisted member of the Army, the Air Force, or the Space Force for articles sold to the member on credit under section 4621(a)(1) or 9621(a)(1) of title 10, as the case may be, shall be deducted from the next pay due the member after the sale is reported.

(c)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an amount that a member of the uniformed services is administratively determined to owe the United States or any of its instrumentalities may be deducted from the member’s pay in monthly installments.

(2) After the deduction of pay forfeited by the sentence of a court-martial, if any, or otherwise authorized by law to be withheld, the deductions authorized by this section may not reduce the pay actually received by a member of the uniformed services for any month to less than one-third of the member’s pay for that month.

(3)(A) If the indebtedness of a member of the uniformed services to the United States is due to the overpayment of pay or allowances to the member through no fault of the member, the amount of the overpayment shall be recovered in monthly installments. The amount deducted from the pay of the member for a month to recover the overpayment amount may not exceed 15 percent of the member’s pay for that month unless the member requests or consents to collection of the overpayment at an accelerated rate.
