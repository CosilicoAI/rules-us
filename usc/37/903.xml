90337:314.Oct. 12, 1949, ch. 681, § 514, 63 Stat. 831.


The word “rating” is inserted for clarity. The words “is entitled to” are substituted for the words “shall . . . be entitled to receive and have the same . . . rights”. The last 41 words of section 314 of existing title 37 are omitted, since the sections mentioned therein were repealed by section 53(b) of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 646). The subject of death benefits and entitlement thereto is now covered by chapter 75 of title 10.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
