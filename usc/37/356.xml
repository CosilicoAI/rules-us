Continuation pay: full TSP members with 7 to 12 years of service(a) Continuation Pay.—The Secretary concerned shall make a payment of continuation pay to each full TSP member (as defined in section 8440e(a) of title 5) of the uniformed services under the jurisdiction of the Secretary who—(1) has completed not less than 7 and not more than 12 years of service in a uniformed service; and
