(B) to restrict the export of items if necessary to further significantly the foreign policy of the United States or to fulfill its declared international obligations.


(2) The national security and foreign policy of the United States require that the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of items, and specific activities of United States persons, wherever located, be controlled for the following purposes:(A) To control the release of items for use in—(i) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or of conventional weapons;

Such leadership requires that United States persons are competitive in global markets. The impact of the implementation of this subchapter on such leadership and competitiveness must be evaluated on an ongoing basis and applied in imposing controls under sections 4812 and 4813 of this title to avoid negatively affecting such leadership.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4811_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) The national security and foreign policy of the United States require that the United States participate in multilateral organizations and agreements regarding export controls on items that are consistent with the policy of the United States, and take all the necessary steps to secure the adoption and consistent enforcement, by the governments of such countries, of export controls on items that are consistent with such policy.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4811_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) Export controls should be coordinated with the multilateral export control regimes.

Thus, the President, in coordination with the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of other Federal agencies, as appropriate, should have a regular and robust process to identify the emerging and other types of critical technologies of concern and regulate their release to foreign persons as warranted regardless of the nature of the underlying transaction. Such identification efforts should draw upon the resources and expertise of all relevant parts of the United States Government, industry, and academia. These efforts should be in addition to traditional efforts to modernize and update the lists of controlled items under the multilateral export control </akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
