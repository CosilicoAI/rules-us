Stockpile responsiveness program(a) Statement of policyIt is the policy of the United States to identify, sustain, enhance, integrate, and continually exercise all capabilities required to conceptualize, study, design, develop, engineer, certify, produce, and deploy nuclear weapons to ensure the nuclear deterrent of the United States remains safe, secure, reliable, credible, and responsive.


(b) Program requiredThe Secretary of Energy, acting through the Administrator and in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall carry out a stockpile responsiveness program, along with the stockpile stewardship program under section 2521 of this title and the stockpile management program under section 2524 of this title, to identify, sustain, enhance, integrate, and continually exercise all capabilities required to conceptualize, study, design, develop, engineer, certify, produce, and deploy nuclear weapons.


(c) ObjectivesThe program under subsection (b) shall have the following objectives:(1) Identify, sustain, enhance, integrate, and continually exercise all of the capabilities, infrastructure, tools, and technologies across the science, engineering, design, certification, and manufacturing cycle required to carry out all phases of the joint nuclear weapons life cycle process, with respect to both the nuclear security enterprise and relevant elements of the Department of Defense.

(2) Identify, enhance, and transfer knowledge, skills, and direct experience with respect to all phases of the joint nuclear weapons life cycle process from one generation of nuclear weapon designers and engineers to the following generation.

(3) Periodically demonstrate stockpile responsiveness throughout the range of capabilities as required, such as through the use of prototypes, flight testing, and development of plans for certification without the need for nuclear explosive testing.

(4) Shorten design, certification, and manufacturing cycles and timelines to minimize the amo</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2538b_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Statement of policy</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Statement of policy It is the policy of the United States to identify, sustain, enhance, integrate, and continually exercise all capabilities required to conceptualize, study, design, develop, engineer, certify, produce, and deploy nuclear weapons to ensure the nuclear deterrent of the United States remains safe, secure, reliable, credible, and responsive.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2538b_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Program required</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Program required The Secretary of Energy, acting through the Administrator and in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall carry out a stockpile responsiveness program, along with the stockpile stewardship program under section 2521 of this title and the stockpile management program under section 2524 of this title, to identify, sustain, enhance, integrate, and continually exercise all capabilities required to conceptualize, study, design, develop, engineer, certify, produce, and deploy nuclear weapons.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2538b_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Objectives</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Objectives The program under subsection (b) shall have the following objectives:</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2538b_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Joint nuclear weapons life cycle process defined</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Joint nuclear weapons life cycle process defined In this section, the term “joint nuclear weapons life cycle process” means the process developed and maintained by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy for the development, production, maintenance, and retirement of nuclear weapons.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
