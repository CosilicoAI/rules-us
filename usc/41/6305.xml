(2) Minimum amount.—This subsection applies only to a contract under which the aggregate amounts due from the Federal Government total at least $1,000.

(3) Accord with contract terms.—Assignment may not be made under this subsection if the contract forbids the assignment.

(4) Full balance due.—Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the contract, an assignment under this subsection must cover the balance of all amounts due from the Federal Government under the contract.

(5) Single assignment.—Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the contract, an assignment under this subsection may not be made to more than one party or be subject to further assignment, except that assignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for 2 or more parties participating in the financing.

(6) Written notice.—The assignee of an assignment under this subsection shall file written notice of the assignment and a true copy of the instrument of assignment with—(A) the contracting officer or head of the officer’s department or agency;
