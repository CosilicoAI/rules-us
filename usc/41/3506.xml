Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data(a) Provision Requiring Adjustment.—(1) In general.—A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under section 3502(b) of this title is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the Federal Government, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that the price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make the certificate available) submitted defective cost or pricing data.

(2) What constitutes defective cost or pricing data.—For the purposes of this chapter, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data that, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed on between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree on a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed on by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.


(b) Valid Defense.—In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it is a defense that the Federal Government did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.

(c) Invalid Defenses.—It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by subsection (a) that—(1) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor—(A) was the sole source of the property </akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3506_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Provision Requiring Adjustment.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a)</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3506_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Valid Defense.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it is a defense that the Federal Government did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3506_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Invalid Defenses.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by subsection (a) that—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3506_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Offsets.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d)</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
