Functions of Secretary; regulations; delegation
The Secretary shall perform the functions and duties imposed upon him by this title, may issue such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out such functions and duties, and may delegate the performance of such functions and duties and the authority to issue such rules and regulations to such officers and employees of the Department of Commerce as he may designate.
(Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158, 68 Stat. 1013; Pub. L. 94–521, § 3(a), Oct. 17, 1976, 90 Stat. 2459.)

S. C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees [now set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees]. That plan transferred all functions (with a few exceptions not applicable to the Census Bureau) of all agencies, officers and employees of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested power in him to delegate the functions so transferred, or any of his other functions, to such agencies, officers or employees within the Department as he designates.
See, also, section 253 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which provided for delegation of functions in connection with the quinquennial censuses of governments, and authorized the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations with respect to such censuses. That section has been omitted from this revised title, as the provision thereof for delegation of functions is covered by this section, and the provision thereof which related to rules and regulations is covered by section 22 of title 1, U.S.C., 1952 ed., General Provisions.
Because of the transfer effected by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, referred to above, sections of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which prescribed functions of the Bureau of the </akn:p></akn:content></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
