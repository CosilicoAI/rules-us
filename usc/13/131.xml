(Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158, 68 Stat. 1019; Pub. L. 85–207, § 8, Aug. 28, 1957, 71 Stat. 482; Pub. L. 88–532, Aug. 31, 1964, 78 Stat. 737.)

Historical and Revision NotesBased on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., § 121 (June 19, 1948, ch. 502, § 1, 62 Stat. 478; June 18, 1954, ch. 315, 68 Stat. 258).
Section was subsection (a) of section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed. The remainder of such section 121, which constituted subsection (b) thereof, is incorporated in subchapter IV of this chapter.
At the beginning, “The Secretary”, meaning the Secretary of Commerce, was substituted for a reference to the Director of the Bureau of the Census, and, at the end, the provision that the territorial scope of the censuses should be determined by the Secretary was substituted for the provision of section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that such determination should be made by the Director with the approval of the Secretary, to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which transferred all functions of all officers and employees, agencies and bureaus of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary. However, the Secretary, under that plan, may delegate any of such transferred functions, as well as any other of his functions, to any of such officers, employees, agencies and bureaus. See, also, section 4 of this title.
