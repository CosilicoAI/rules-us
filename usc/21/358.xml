Authority to designate official names(a) Necessity or desirability; use in official compendiums; infringement of trademarksThe Secretary may designate an official name for any drug or device if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity. Any official name designated under this section for any drug or device shall be the only official name of that drug or device used in any official compendium published after such name has been prescribed or for any other purpose of this chapter. In no event, however, shall the Secretary establish an official name so as to infringe a valid trademark.


(b) Review of names in official compendiumsWithin a reasonable time after October 10, 1962, and at such other times as he may deem necessary, the Secretary shall cause a review to be made of the official names by which drugs are identified in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, the official Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, and the official National Formulary, and all supplements thereto, and at such times as he may deem necessary shall cause a review to be made of the official names by which devices are identified in any official compendium (and all supplements thereto) to determine whether revision of any of those names is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity.


(c) Determinations of complexity, usefulness, multiplicity, or lack of name; designation by SecretaryWhenever he determines after any such review that (1) any such official name is unduly complex or is not useful for any other reason, (2) two or more official names have been applied to a single drug or device, or to two or more drugs which are identical in chemical structure and pharmacological action and which are substantially identical in strength, quality, and purity, or to two or more devices which are substantially equivalent in design and purpose or (3) no official name has been applied to a medically u</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_358_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Necessity or desirability; use in official compendiums; infringement of trademarks</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Necessity or desirability; use in official compendiums; infringement of trademarks The Secretary may designate an official name for any drug or device if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity.
