In subsection (a), the words “by regulations” are omitted, since the Secretary has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his statutory functions. The words “as an officer of the Army National Guard to any person” are substituted for the words “to any officer of the National Guard or Air National Guard”.
