Procurement authority for family housing(a) The Secretary is authorized—(1) to acquire, subject to the availability of appropriations sufficient to cover its full obligations, real property or interests therein by purchase, lease for a term not to exceed 5 years, or otherwise, for use as Coast Guard family housing units, including the acquisition of condominium units, which may include the obligation to pay maintenance, repair, and other condominium-related fees; and

(2) to dispose of by sale, lease, or otherwise, any real property or interest therein used for Coast Guard family housing units for adequate consideration.


(b)(1) For the purposes of this section, a multiyear contract is a contract to lease Coast Guard family housing units for at least one, but not more than 5, fiscal years.

(2) The Secretary may enter into multiyear contracts under subsection (a) of this section whenever the Coast Guard finds that—(A) the use of a contract will promote the efficiency of the Coast Guard family housing program and will result in reduced total costs under the contract; and

(B) there are realistic estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear contract.


(3) A multiyear contract authorized under subsection (a) of this section shall contain cancellation and termination provisions to the extent necessary to protect the best interests of the United States, and may include consideration of both recurring and nonrecurring costs. The contract may provide for a cancellation payment to be made. Amounts that were originally obligated for the cost of the contract may be used for cancellation or termination costs.
