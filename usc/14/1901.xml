(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 508, § 181; renumbered § 1901, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, § 110(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4212.)

Historical and Revision NotesThis section does not change the present method of administration of the Academy. It makes statutory what has been administrative regulation heretofore, and it is believed highly desirable to make the control of an institution of such national interest as the Academy the subject of a statute.
This section is new. There is no provision in existing law which establishes the Academy and sets it up as an operating unit. Nor is there any provision which creates the office of Superintendent of the Academy, or prescribes his duties and functions. Heretofore this has been accomplished by regulations, and the laws which deal with the Academy assume its existence as a going institution and assume the existence of the Superintendent with certain defined functions and duties. This section continues the Academy as previously established, provides for the appointment of the Superintendent by the Commandant, and defines in general terms his functions. The Academy would thus be placed on a definite statutory basis, and the office of Superintendent would be a statutory position, but the present administration of the Academy would in no way be interfered with. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
