A board shall consist of at least 5 officers (other than the Commandant) serving in the grade of admiral or vice admiral or as rear admirals previously continued. Boards shall be convened frequently enough to assure that each officer serving in the grade of rear admiral (lower half) or rear admiral is subject to consideration for continuation during a promotion year in which that officer completes not less than four or more than five years combined service in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral.

(b) The Secretary shall, based upon the needs of the service, furnish each board convened under this section with the number of officers to be considered for continuation on active duty. The number that may be recommended for continuation shall be not less than 50 per centum or more than 75 per centum of the number of officers being considered for continuation.
