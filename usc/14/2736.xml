Distinguished service medal
The President may present, but not in the name of Congress, a distinguished service medal of appropriate design, with accompanying ribbon, together with a rosette or other device, to be worn in lieu thereof, to any individual who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, performs exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility.
(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 535, § 492; renumbered § 2736, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, § 116(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4226; Pub. L. 116–283, div. G, title LVXXXV [LXXXV], §§ 8505(a)(29), 8506(d), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4749, 4752.)

Historical and Revision NotesThis section is new insofar as application to Coast Guard personnel in time of peace is concerned. Such awards can be made to members of the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy.
The language is parallel to that found in title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., § 355, providing for awards to personnel of the Navy. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Editorial Notes
Amendments2021—Pub. L. 116–283 substituted “individual” for “person” and “performs” for “distinguishes himself by”.
2018—Pub. L. 115–282 renumbered section 492 of this title as this section.
