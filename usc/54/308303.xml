Preservation and interpretation of Underground Railroad history, historic sites, and structures(a) Authority To Make Grants.—The Secretary may make grants in accordance with this section for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings or structures associated with the Underground Railroad, and for related research and documentation to sites, programs, or facilities that have been included in the national network.

(b) Grant Conditions.—Any grant made under this section shall provide that—(1) no change or alteration may be made in property for which the grant is used except with the agreement of the property owner and the Secretary;

(2) the Secretary shall have the right of access at reasonable times to the public portions of the property for interpretive and other purposes; and

(3) conversion, use, or disposal of the property for purposes contrary to the purposes of this chapter, as determined by the Secretary, shall result in a right of the United States to compensation equal to all Federal funds made available to the grantee under this chapter.


(c) Matching Requirement.—The Secretary may obligate funds made available for a grant under this section only if the grantee agrees to match, from funds derived from non-Federal sources, the amount of the grant with an amount that is equal to or greater than the grant.
