In subsection (a), the words “Except as provided in section 8786 of this title” are inserted, since, under that revised section, when board proceedings are pending against a commissioned officer, his right to retire under this revised section, which is otherwise absolute, is discretionary with the Secretary under that revised section.
In subsections (a) and (b), the words “or volunteer service, or both” are omitted as obsolete in accordance with an opinion of the Attorney General, 22 Ops. Atty.

The words “upon his request” are substituted for the words “if he make application therefor to the President”.
In subsection (b), the applicability of 10:942 to warrant officers is based on an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1950/6951, 4 Jan. 1951), which hol</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9324_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Except as provided in section 1186 of this title, a commissioned officer of the Air Force or the Space Force who has at least 40 years of service computed under section 9326 of this title shall be retired upon his request.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_9324_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Any warrant officer of the Air Force or the Space Force who has at least 40 years of service computed under section 9326(a) of this title shall be retired upon his request.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
