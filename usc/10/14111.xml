Reports of selection boards: transmittal to President(a) Transmittal to President.—The Secretary concerned, after final review of the report of a selection board under section 14110 of this title, shall submit the report with the Secretary’s recommendations, to the Secretary of Defense for transmittal by the Secretary to the President for approval or disapproval. If the authority of the President to approve or disapprove the report of a promotion board is delegated to the Secretary of Defense, that authority may not be redelegated except to an official in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

(b) Removal of Name From Board Report.—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the name of an officer recommended for promotion by a selection board may be removed from the report of the selection board only by the President.

(2) In the case of an officer recommended by a selection board for promotion to a grade below brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half), the name of the officer may also be removed from the report of the selection board by the Secretary of Defense or the Deputy Secretary of Defense.


(c) Recommendations for Removal of Selected Officers From Report.—If the Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of Defense makes a recommendation under this section that the name of an officer be removed from the report of a promotion board and the recommendation is accompanied by information that was not presented to that promotion board, that information shall be made available to that officer. The officer shall then be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit comments on that information to the officials making the recommendation and the officials reviewing the recommendation. If an eligible officer cannot be given access to such information because of its classification status, the officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be provided with an appropriate summary of the information.
