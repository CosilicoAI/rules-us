Editorial Notes
Amendments2021—Pub. L. 116–283 renumbered section 2546a of this title as this section and transferred it so as to appear after section 3101 of this title. Directory language transferring this section “within such section” was executed as if it had read “within such chapter”, meaning chapter 205 of this title, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
