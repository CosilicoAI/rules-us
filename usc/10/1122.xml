The President, under regulations to be prescribed by him, may award a decoration called the “Medal for Merit”, having distinctive appurtenances and devices and only one degree, to any civilian of any nation prosecuting the war in existence on July 20, 1942, under the joint declaration of the United Nations, as then constituted, or of any other friendly foreign nation, who, after September 8, 1939, has distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious conduct in performing outstanding services.

The words “in existence on July 20, 1942” are inserted for clarity and refer to the war in existence on the date of enactment of the source statute. The words “as then constituted” are inserted for clarity, since the United Nations organization in existence on July 20, 1942, was not the present United Nations organization. The words “There is created”, “rules and”, and “the proclamation of an emergency by the President on” are omitted as surplusage.
