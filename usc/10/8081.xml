In subsection (a) the words “from officers on the active list in the line of the Navy” are substituted for the words “from the list of officers of the Navy” to conform to current terminology. Line officers alone had the “grade” of commander when the source statute was enacted. The words “or from officers having the rank of captain in the staff corps of the Navy” are omitted as obsolete in view of subsequent changes in the staff corps and in the staff corps ranks and grades. These words were derived from the Act of Mar. 3, 1871, ch. 117, § 10, 16 Stat. 537, which established new staff corps grades and assigned to officers in the highest grade the relative rank of captain. They were probably intended merely to assure the eligibility of senior staff corps</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8081_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) The Chief of Naval Personnel shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of four years, from officers on the active-duty list in the line of the Navy not below the grade of commander.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8081_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(b) An officer on the active-duty list in the line of the Navy not below the grade of commander may be detailed as Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
