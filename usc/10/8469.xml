696934 U.S.C. 1091a.Feb. 14, 1931, ch. 184, 46 Stat. 1111; July 17, 1953, ch. 226, § 2, 67 Stat. 181.

The second sentence covers that part of the second proviso which relates to pay and makes reference to the Career Compensation Act of 1949, since it is that Act which governs entitlement to basic pay and the computation of cumulative years of creditable service. Retirement rights and reenlistment bonuses referred to in the second proviso are covered in the third sentence of this subsection, giving recognition to the fact that the status of the </akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8469_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) The Naval Academy Band shall be composed of one leader, one second leader, and such enlisted members of the Navy as may be assigned.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8469_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(b) In determining years of service for the purpose of retirement, and in determining eligibility for reenlistment bonus, the members who are assigned as leader and second leader shall be treated as if they had not been so assigned.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_8469_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(c) The enlisted members assigned to the Naval Academy Band shall be distributed in grade substantially the same as in the United States Navy Band.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
