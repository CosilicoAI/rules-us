Although 10:1429 refers to persons serving “with the Air Corps of the Army”, and the functions of the Army Air Corps have been transferred to the Air Force under section 208(b) of the National Security Act of 1947 (5 U.S.C. 626c(b)), members of the Army continue to participate in aerial flights and are eligible for the award of the distinguished flying cross.
In subsection (a), the words “Under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe” are omitted, since the President has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his functions. The words “but not in the name of Congress” are omitted as surplusage, since a medal is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs.
