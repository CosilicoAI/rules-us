The words “in the discretion of” and “from time to time, from the Corps of Engineers, by the President, for this duty” are omitted as surplusage. 10:189 (last sentence) is omitted as obsolete.
In subsections (a) and (b), the words “assigned to” are substituted for the word “of”, since, under section 3063 of this title, officers are assigned to, rather than commissioned in, the Corps of Engineers.
In subsection (b), the words “assist that officer” are substituted for the words “act as assistants to said engineer commissioner”. The words “his duties” are substituted for the words “the special duties imposed upon him”.
