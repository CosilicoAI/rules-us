Indemnification of Department of Transportation for losses covered by vessel war risk insurance(a) Prompt Indemnification Required.—(1) In the event of a loss that is covered by vessel war risk insurance, the Secretary of Defense shall promptly indemnify the Secretary of Transportation for the amount of the loss consistent with the indemnification agreement between the two Secretaries that underlies such insurance. The Secretary of Defense shall make such indemnification—(A) in the case of a claim for the loss of a vessel, not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary of Transportation determines the claim to be payable or that amounts are due under the policy that provided the vessel war risk insurance; and

(B) in the case of any other claim, not later than 180 days after the date on which the Secretary of Transportation determines the claim to be payable.


(2) When there is a loss of a vessel that is (or may be) covered by vessel war risk insurance, the Secretary of Transportation may make, during the period when a claim for such loss is pending with the Secretary of Transportation, any required periodic payments owed by the insured party to a lessor or mortgagee of such vessel. Such payments shall commence not later than 30 days following the date of the presentment of the claim for the loss of the vessel to the Secretary of Transportation. If the Secretary of Transportation determines that the claim is payable, any amount paid under this paragraph arising from such claim shall be credited against the amount payable under the vessel war risk insurance. If the Secretary of Transportation determines that the claim is not payable, any amount paid under this paragraph arising from such claim shall constitute a debt to the United States, payable to the insurance fund. Any such amounts so returned to the United States shall be promptly credited to the fund or account from which the payments were made under this paragraph.
