Contingency construction(a) Within the amount appropriated for such purpose, the Secretary of Defense may carry out a military construction project not otherwise authorized by law, or may authorize the Secretary of a military department to carry out such a project, if the Secretary of Defense determines that deferral of the project for inclusion in the next Military Construction Authorization Act would be inconsistent with national security or national interest.

Each such report shall include the justification for the project, the current estimate of the cost of the project, and the justification for carrying out the project under this section. The project may then be carried out only after the end of the seven-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by such committees in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.
