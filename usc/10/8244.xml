Historical and Revision Notes

608434 U.S.C. 908.July 1, 1902, ch. 1368, 32 Stat. 680 (4th par.); Mar. 14, 1940, ch. 53, 54 Stat. 50.


The words “basic allowance for subsistence” are substituted for the words “money accruing from the commuted rations” to conform to the terminology of § 301 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 251). Section 301 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 supersedes the authority of the Secretary of the Navy to commute the rations of enlisted members and authorizes in lieu thereof a basic allowance for subsistence. The words “enlisted members of the naval service” are substituted for the words “enlisted men” for uniformity of expression and for clarity. The word “legally” is omitted as surplusage. The words “and subsisting in” are inserted to make it clear that the mess must actually subsist the enlisted members assigned before the basic allowance of the members may be paid to the mess. The words “to which they are assigned” are inserted for clarity.
