Facilities: use of renewable forms of energy and energy efficient products(a) Use of Renewable Forms of Energy Encouraged.—The Secretary of Defense shall encourage the use of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy as a source of energy for military construction projects (including military family housing projects) and facility repairs and renovations where use of such form of energy is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance master plan for the Department of Defense developed under section 2911 of this title and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (e) of such section.

(b) Consideration During Design Phase of Projects.—(1) The Secretary concerned shall require that the design for the construction, repair, or renovation of facilities (including family housing and back-up power generation facilities) requires consideration of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy when use of a renewable form of energy—(A) is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance master plan for the Department of Defense developed under section 2911 of this title; and

(B) supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (e) of such section.


(2) The Secretary concerned shall require that contracts for construction resulting from such design include a requirement that energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy be installed if such systems can be shown to be cost effective.


(c) Determination of Cost Effectiveness.—(1) For the purposes of this section, an energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy for a facility shall be considered to be cost effective if the difference between (A) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility with such a system, and (B) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility without such a system can be recovered over </akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2915_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Use of Renewable Forms of Energy Encouraged.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) The Secretary of Defense shall encourage the use of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy as a source of energy for military construction projects (including military family housing projects) and facility repairs and renovations where use of such form of energy is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance master plan for the Department of Defense developed under section 2911 of this title and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (e) of such section.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2915_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Consideration During Design Phase of Projects.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b)</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2915_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Determination of Cost Effectiveness.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c)</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2915_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Exception to Square Feet and Cost Per Square Foot Limitations.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) In order to equip a military construction project (including a military family housing project) with heating equipment, cooling equipment, or both heating and cooling equipment using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy or with a passive energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy, the Secretary concerned may authorize an increase in any otherwise applicable limitation with respect to the number of square feet or the cost per square foot of the project by such amount as may be necessary for such purpose. Any such increase under this subsection shall be in addition to any other administrative increase in cost per square foot or variation in floor area authorized by law.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2915_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Use of Energy Efficient Products in Facilities.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e)</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
