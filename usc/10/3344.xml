The words “company, or corporation” are omitted as included in “person” because of section 1:1. The words “On and after the date of enactment of this Act” are omitted as executed. The word “contractor” is substituted for “person, company, or corporation to whom such contract has been awarded” and “person, company, or corporation to whom any defense contract has been awarded” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “and the identity of the contractor” are substituted for “and to whom it was awarded” for clarity.
