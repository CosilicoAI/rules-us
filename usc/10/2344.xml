(B) The price charged a recipient country for supplies furnished by a supplying country from its inventory, and the price charged a recipient country for logistics support and services furnished by the officers, employees, or governmental agencies of a supplying country, shall be the same as the price charged for identical supplies, support, or services acquired by an armed force of the supplying country from such governmental sources.
