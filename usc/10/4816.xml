National technology and industrial base: periodic defense capability assessments(a) Periodic Assessment.—Each fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense shall prepare selected assessments of the capability of the national technology and industrial base to attain the national security objectives set forth in section 4811(a) of this title. The Secretary of Defense shall prepare such assessments in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy.

(b) Assessment Process.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that technology and industrial capability assessments—(1) describe sectors or capabilities, their underlying infrastructure and processes;

(2) analyze present and projected financial performance of industries supporting the sectors or capabilities in the assessment;

(3) determine the extent to which the requirements associated with defense acquisition programs can be satisfied by the present and projected performance capacities of industries supporting the sectors or capabilities in the assessment, evaluate the reasons for any variance from applicable preceding determinations, and identify the extent to which those industries are comprised of only one potential source in the national technology and industrial base or have multiple potential sources;

(4) determine the extent to which the requirements associated with defense acquisition programs can be satisfied by the present and projected performance capacities of industries that do not actively support Department of Defense acquisition programs and identify the barriers to the participation of those industries;

(5) identify technological and industrial capabilities and processes for which there is potential for the national industrial and technology base not to be able to support the achievement of national security objectives; and

(6) consider the effects of the termination of major defense acquisition programs (as the term is defined in section 4201 of this title 11 So in original</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_4816_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Periodic Assessment.—</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Each fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense shall prepare selected assessments of the capability of the national technology and industrial base to attain the national security objectives set forth in section 4811(a) of this title.
