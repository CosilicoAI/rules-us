Historical and Revision Notes


Revised sectionSource (U.S. Code)Source (Statutes at Large)


550834 U.S.C. 306f(d)(2).Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, § 311(d)(2), 61 Stat. 852; Aug. 5, 1949, ch. 402, § 1(c), 63 Stat. 568.


The word “rank” is substituted for the words “take precedence” throughout the section for uniformity of expression.
In subsection (a) the first sentence is broadened to include officers of the Marine Corps and officers not on a lineal list. Inclusion of the Marine Corps is possible because the sentence reflects the rule referred to by the Attorney General (25 Op. Atty. Gen. 517) as “an unwritten law of the Army and Navy” as to relative rank between officers in different services. Officers not on a lineal list may properly be included since the statement is consistent with the provisions for assigning lineal position to such officers when they become entitled to be placed on a list.
