In subsection (a) the words “appropriated funds” are substituted for the words “naval appropriations”, and the definition of “naval personnel” in 5 U.S.C. 421g, which is applicable to this section, is executed. In executing this definition the words “while on active duty” are omitted as unnecessary, since a member not on active duty would not have an official station within the meaning of this section.
