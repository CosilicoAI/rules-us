Before the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, the transport functions covered by this section were performed only by the Army. Under section 2(a)(3) of the National Security Act (as it existed before August 10, 1949), the sea and air transportation functions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were respectively consolidated into the “Military Sea Transportation Service”, under the Department of the Navy, and the “Military Air Transport Service”, under the Department of the Air Force. Instead of having space on its own transport vessels and airplanes, the Army is now allotted bulk space on vessels and airplanes operated by those transport services. The words “or, within bulk space allocations made to the Department of the Army, on vessels or airplanes operated by any military transport agency of the Department of Defense” are inserted, in accordance with an opinion of the Judge A</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2650_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) the Secretary of Defense considers that accommodations are available;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2650_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) the transportation is without expense to the United States;</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2650_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) the transportation is limited to one round trip between Alaska and the United States during any two-year period, except in an emergency such as sickness or death; and</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2650_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) in case of travel by air, the transportation cannot be reasonably handled by a United States commercial air carrier.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
