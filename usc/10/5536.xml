(ii) has the ability to accomplish the intended mission of the covered system; and



(2) the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation has carried out subsection (b) with respect to such covered system.


(b) Assessment by Director of Operational Test and Evaluation.—The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation shall—(1) provide to the Secretary the assessment of the Director, based on the available test data, of the sufficiency, adequacy, and results of the testing of each covered system, including an assessment of whether the covered system will be sufficiently effective, suitable, and survivable when needed; and
