3016(a)3016(b)3016(c)5:185.5:186.5:187.R.S. 215; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69 (2d par.), 19 Stat. 241.
  Mar. 4, 1874, ch. 44, 18 Stat. 19.


Although 5:185, 186, and 187 are omitted from the United States Code as covered by 5:181–5, they are not so superseded and are restated in this revised section.
In subsections (a), (b), and (c), the title “Administrative Assistant” is substituted for the title “Assistant and Chief Clerk”, to accord with present usage. R.S. 215 (less last sentence) is not contained in 5:185 and 186. It is also omitted from the revised section as obsolete.
In subsection (a), the words “an inferior officer” are omitted, since the Secretary’s authority to appoint the Administrative Assistant makes the office an inferior office within the meaning of the Constitution. The words “perform duties that the Secretary considers appropriate” are substituted for the words “to be employed therein as he shall deem proper”.
In subsection (b), the words “During a vacancy i</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_7018_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(a) There is an Administrative Assistant in the Department of the Army.
