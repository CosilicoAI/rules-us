Health care services incurred on behalf of covered beneficiaries: collection from third-party payers(a)(1) In the case of a person who is a covered beneficiary, the United States shall have the right to collect from a third-party payer reasonable charges for health care services incurred by the United States on behalf of such person through a facility of the uniformed services to the extent that the person would be eligible to receive reimbursement or indemnification from the third-party payer if the person were to incur such charges on the person’s own behalf. If the insurance, medical service, or health plan of that payer includes a requirement for a deductible or copayment by the beneficiary of the plan, then the amount that the United States may collect from the third-party payer is a reasonable charge for the care provided less the appropriate deductible or copayment amount.

(2) A covered beneficiary may not be required to pay an additional amount to the United States for health care services by reason of this section.


(b) No provision of any insurance, medical service, or health plan contract or agreement having the effect of excluding from coverage or limiting payment of charges for certain care shall operate to prevent collection by the United States under subsection (a) if that care is provided—(1) through a facility of the uniformed services;

(2) directly or indirectly by a governmental entity;

(3) to an individual who has no obligation to pay for that care or for whom no other person has a legal obligation to pay; or

(4) by a provider with which the third party payer has no participation agreement.
