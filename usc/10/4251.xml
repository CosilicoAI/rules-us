Major defense acquisition programs: factors to be considered before Milestone A approval(a) Responsibilities.—Before granting Milestone A approval for a major defense acquisition program or a major subprogram, the milestone decision authority for the program or subprogram shall ensure that—(1) information about the program or subprogram is sufficient to warrant entry of the program or subprogram into the risk reduction phase;

(2) the cost, schedule, technical feasibility, and performance trade-offs that have been made with regard to the program do not overly constrain future trade space; and

(3) there are sound plans for progression of the program or subprogram to the development phase.


(b) Factors to Be Considered for Milestone a Approval.—A major defense acquisition program or subprogram may not receive Milestone A approval or otherwise be initiated prior to Milestone B approval until the milestone decision authority confirms that the following factors were considered in the decision to grant Milestone A approval:(1) The program or subprogram fulfills an approved requirements document.

(2) The program or subprogram has conducted appropriate market research.

(3) With respect to any identified areas of risk, there is a plan to reduce the risk.

(4) Planning for sustainment has been addressed.

(5) An analysis of alternatives has been performed consistent with study guidance developed by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, or in lieu of an analysis of alternatives, early experimentation with a combatant commander has been conducted.

(6) A life cycle cost estimate for the program or subprogram has been submitted by the component and that the level of resources required to complete the technology maturation and risk reduction phase of the program is sufficient for successful program execution.

(7) The program or subprogram meets any other considerations the milestone decision authority considers relevant.
