(b) Notification under subsection (a) may not be made if—(1) the disability was the result of the member’s intentional misconduct, willful neglect, or willful failure to comply with standards and qualifications for retention established by the Secretary concerned; or

(2) the disability was incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.
