In subsection (b), the word “grade” is substituted for the word “rank”. The words “pay, allowances” are omitted, since they are determined by the grade held. The words “retirement rights” are omitted as covered by the word “benefits”. The words “There is authorized”, “from time to time”, and “statutory” are omitted as surplusage.

1958 ActThe word “regular” is deleted [in sections 4335 and 4336] to make clear that a Dean or professor of the United States Military Academy holds only the office of “Dean” or “professor” and not the office of “brigadier general” or “colonel”, as the case may be, even though he is entitled to the pay and allowances of that grade.
