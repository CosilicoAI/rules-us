In subsection (a), the word “title” is substituted for the word “chapter”. The provisions of this title relating to active duty of Reserves are based on the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952. The words “under his jurisdiction” are inserted for clarity. The words “or active duty for training” are omitted as covered by the words “active duty”.
Subsection (b) is substituted for 50:967(b). Clause (3) is inserted, since other provisions of law are necessarily exceptions to the general rule here stated.
