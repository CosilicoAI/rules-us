The word “commissioned” is inserted, since the retirement of warrant officers for length of service is covered by section 1293 of this title. The word “regular” is inserted, since 10:943 is applicable historically only to officers of the Regular Army. The words “and placed on the retired list” are omitted as surplusage. The words “computed under section 3926 of this title” are inserted for clarity.
