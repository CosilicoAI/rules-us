(3) A scholarship program for the purpose of qualifying personnel for acquisition positions in the Department of Defense.


(b) Scholarship Program Requirements.—Each recipient of a scholarship under a program conducted under subsection (a)(3) shall be required to sign a written agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions of the scholarship.
