In subsection (a) the words “each officer stationed at the Naval Academy, each midshipman officer, each midshipman petty officer, and each civilian member of the teaching staff of the Academy shall” are substituted for the words “it shall be the duty of every professor, assistant professor, academic officer, or any cadet officer or cadet petty officer, or instructor, as well as every other officer stationed at the United States Naval Academy to” to state the current applicability of the provision. The words “commission of hazing” are substituted for the words “violation * * * of any of the provisions of this Act”.
