(2) not guilty; or

(3) subject to subsection (d), not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility.


(d) Majority Vote Required for Finding.—The accused shall be found not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility under subsection (c)(3) only if a majority of the members present at the time the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established.
