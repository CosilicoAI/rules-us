Midshipmen: allotment upon redistricting of Congressional Districts
If as a result of redistricting a State the domicile of a midshipman, or a nominee, nominated by a Representative falls within a congressional district other than that from which he was nominated, he is charged to the district in which his domicile so falls. For this purpose, the number of midshipmen otherwise authorized for that district is increased to include him. However, the number as so increased is reduced by one if he fails to become a midshipman or when he is finally separated from the Naval Academy.

The word “domicile” is substituted for the words “place of residence” to conform to the long-standing interpretation of this section (see also opinions of the Judge Advocate General of the Army R. 29, 83; J.A.G. 351.11, Feb. 10, 1925). The words “a congressional district other than that from which he was nominated” are substituted for the word “another”. The words “were appointed with respect to”, “of the former district”, “as additional numbers”, “at such academy for the Representative”, “temporarily”, and “in attendance at either academy under an appointment from such former district” are omitted as surplusage. The words “the district in which his domicile so falls” are substituted for the words “of the latter district”. The words “to include him” are substituted for 34 U.S.C. 1032–1 (18 words before proviso). The words “However, the number as so increased” are substituted for 34 U.S.C. 1032–1 (1st 13 words of proviso). The words “if he fails to become a midshipman” are inserted for clarity.
