(2) an amount specified in a consent which would not constitute a dividend (as defined in section 316) if the total amounts specified in consents filed by the corporation had been distributed in money to shareholders on the last day of the taxable year of such corporation.


(c) Effect of consentThe amount of a consent dividend shall be considered, for purposes of this title—(1) as distributed in money by the corporation to the shareholder on the last day of the taxable year of the corporation, and
