Such tax shall be determined by such means as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe, and with the use of such devices and apparatus (including but not limited to tanks and pipelines) as the Secretary may require. The tax on distilled spirits withdrawn from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant shall be determined upon completion of the gauge for determination of tax and before withdrawal from bonded premises, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe.


(2) Distilled spirits not accounted forIf the Secretary finds that the distiller has not accounted for all the distilled spirits produced by him, he shall, from all the evidence he can obtain, determine what quantity of distilled spirits was actually produced by such distiller, and an assessment shall be made for the difference between the quantity reported and the quantity shown to have been actually produced at the rate of tax imposed by law for every proof gallon.



(b) Taxable loss(1) On original quantityWhere there is evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that there has been any loss of distilled spirits from any cask or other package deposited on bonded premises, other than a loss which by reason of section 5008(a) is not taxable, the Secretary may require the withdrawal from bonded premises of such distilled spirits, and direct the officer designated by him to collect the tax accrued on the original quantity of distilled spirits entered for deposit on bonded premises in such cask or package; except that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, when the extent of any loss from causes other than theft or unauthorized voluntary destruction can be established by the proprietor to the satisfaction of the Secretary an allowance of the tax on the loss so established may be credited aga</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5006_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Requirements</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Requirements</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5006_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Taxable loss</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Taxable loss</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5006_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>Distilled spirits not bonded</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) Distilled spirits not bonded</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5006_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Unlawfully imported distilled spirits</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Unlawfully imported distilled spirits Distilled spirits smuggled or brought into the United States unlawfully shall, for purposes of this chapter, be held to be imported into the United States, and the internal revenue tax shall be due and payable at the time of such importation.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_5006_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Cross reference</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Cross reference For provisions relating to removal of distilled spirits from bonded premises on determination of tax, see section 5213.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
