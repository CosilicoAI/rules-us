For purposes of the preceding sentence, an activity does not lose identity as a trade or business merely because it is carried on within a larger aggregate of similar activities or within a larger complex of other endeavors which may, or may not, be related to the exempt purposes of the organization. Where an activity carried on for profit constitutes an unrelated trade or business, no part of such trade or business shall be excluded from such classification merely because it does not result in profit.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_513_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Certain activities of trade shows, State fairs, etc.</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Certain activities of trade shows, State fairs, etc.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_513_e"><akn:num>(e)</akn:num><akn:heading>Certain hospital services</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(e) Certain hospital services In the case of a hospital described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii), the term “unrelated trade or business” does not include the furnishing of one or more of the services described in section 501(e)(1)(A) to one or more hospitals described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii) if—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_513_f"><akn:num>(f)</akn:num><akn:heading>Certain bingo games</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(f) Certain bingo games</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_513_g"><akn:num>(g)</akn:num><akn:heading>Certain pole rentals</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(g) Certain pole rentals In the case of a mutual or cooperative telephone or electric company, the term “unrelated trade or business” does not include engaging in qualified pole rentals (as defined in section 501(c)(12)(D)).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_513_h"><akn:num>(h)</akn:num><akn:heading>Certain distributions of low cost articles without obligation to purchase and exchanges and rentals of member lists</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(h) Certain distributions of low cost articles without obligation to purchase and exchanges and rentals of member lists</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_513_i"><akn:num>(i)</akn:num><akn:heading>Treatment of certain sponsorship payments</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(i) Treatment of certain sponsorship payments</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_513_j"><akn:num>(j)</akn:num><akn:heading>Debt management plan services</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(j) Debt management plan services The term “unrelated trade or business” includes the provision of debt management plan services (as defined in section 501(q)(4)(B)) by any organization other than an organization which meets the requirements of section 501(q).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
