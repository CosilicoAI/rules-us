Utilization of services, materials, funds, etc., of Federal, State, or municipal agencies, or of individuals
In connection with the investigation, construction, or operation and maintenance of a project, pursuant to the authority of this subchapter, the Secretary is authorized to utilize (1) in such manner as the President may direct, services, labor, materials, or other property, including money, supplied by the Work Projects Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Office of Indian Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, or any other Federal agency, for which the United States shall be reimbursed in such amounts as the President may fix for each project, within the limits of the water users’ ability to repay costs as found by the Secretary under section 590z–1(a)(iv) of this title; and (2) such services, labor, materials, easements or property, including money, as may be contributed by any State or political subdivision thereof, State agency, municipal corporation, or other organization, or individuals, if, in the judgment of the Secretary, the acceptance thereof will not impair the title of the United States to the project works and will not reduce the probability that the project water users can meet the obligations to the United States entered into pursuant to this subchapter. Moneys received and accepted under (2) of this section shall be and remain available for expenditure for the purposes for which contributed in like manner as if said sums had been specifically appropriated for said purposes.
