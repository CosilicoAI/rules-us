Bycatch reduction engineering program(a) Bycatch reduction engineering programNot later than 1 year after January 12, 2007, the Secretary, in cooperation with the Councils and other affected interests, and based upon the best scientific information available, shall establish a bycatch reduction program, including grants, to develop technological devices and other conservation engineering changes designed to minimize bycatch, seabird interactions, bycatch mortality, and post-release mortality in Federally managed fisheries. The program shall—(1) be regionally based;

(2) be coordinated with projects conducted under the cooperative research and management program established under this chapter;

(3) provide information and outreach to fishery participants that will encourage adoption and use of technologies developed under the program; and

(4) provide for routine consultation with the Councils in order to maximize opportunities to incorporate results of the program in Council actions and provide incentives for adoption of methods developed under the program in fishery management plans developed by the Councils.


(b) IncentivesAny fishery management plan prepared by a Council or by the Secretary may establish a system of incentives to reduce total bycatch and seabird interactions, amounts, bycatch rates, and post-release mortality in fisheries under the Council’s or Secretary’s jurisdiction, including—(1) measures to incorporate bycatch into quotas, including the establishment of collective or individual bycatch quotas;

(2) measures to promote the use of gear with verifiable and monitored low bycatch and seabird interactions, rates; and

(3) measures that, based on the best scientific information available, will reduce bycatch and seabird interactions, bycatch mortality, post-release mortality, or regulatory discards in the fishery.
