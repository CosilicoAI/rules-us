Apportionments among participating States shall be determined by the Secretary after consultation with the council appointed under section 582a–4 of this title. In making such apportionments, consideration shall be given to pertinent factors including non-Federal expenditures for forestry research by State-certified eligible institutions, areas of non-Federal commercial forest land, and the volume of timber cut annually.
