Urban and community forestry assistance(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that—(1) the health of forests in urban areas and communities, including cities, their suburbs, and towns, in the United States is on the decline;

(2) forest lands, shade trees, and open spaces in urban areas and communities improve the quality of life for residents;

(3) forest lands and associated natural resources enhance the economic value of residential and commercial property in urban and community settings;

(4) urban trees are 15 times more effective than forest trees at reducing the buildup of carbon dioxide and aid in promoting energy conservation through mitigation of the heat island effect in urban areas;

(5) tree plantings and ground covers such as low growing dense perennial turfgrass sod in urban areas and communities can aid in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, mitigating the heat island effect, and reducing energy consumption, thus contributing to efforts to reduce global warming trends;

(6) efforts to encourage tree plantings and protect existing open spaces in urban areas and communities can contribute to the social well-being and promote a sense of community in these areas; and

(7) strengthened research, education, technical assistance, and public information and participation in tree planting and maintenance programs for trees and complementary ground covers for urban and community forests are needed to provide for the protection and expansion of tree cover and open space in urban areas and communities.


(b) PurposesThe purposes of this section are to—(1) improve understanding of the benefits of preserving existing tree cover in urban areas and communities;

(2) encourage owners of private residences and commercial properties to maintain trees and expand forest cover on their properties;

(3) provide education programs and technical assistance to State and local organizations (including community associations and schools) in maintaining forested lands and individ</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2105_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Findings</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Findings The Congress finds that—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2105_b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:heading>Purposes</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(b) Purposes The purposes of this section are to—</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2105_c"><akn:num>(c)</akn:num><akn:heading>General authority</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(c) General authority The Secretary is authorized to provide financial, technical, and related assistance to State foresters or equivalent State officials for the purpose of encouraging States to provide information and technical assistance to units of local government and others that will encourage cooperative efforts to plan urban forestry programs and to plant, protect, and maintain, and utilize wood from, trees in open spaces, greenbelts, roadside screens, parks, woodlands, curb areas, and residential developments in urban areas. In providing such assistance, the Secretary is authorized to cooperate with interested members of the public, including nonprofit private organizations. The Secretary is also authorized to cooperate directly with units of local government and others in implementing this section whenever the Secretary and the affected State forester or equivalent State official agree that direct cooperation would better achieve the purposes of this section.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_2105_d"><akn:num>(d)</akn:num><akn:heading>Program of education and technical assistance</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(d) Program of education and technical assistance The Secretary, in cooperation with State foresters and State extension directors or equivalent State officials and interested members of the public, including nonprofit private organizations, shall implement a program of education and technical assistance for urban and community forest resources.
