(b) StudyNot later than 180 days after November 15, 2021, the Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, shall conduct a study to identify incentive-based, including performance-based, rate treatments for the transmission and sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission that could be used to encourage—(1) investment by public utilities in advanced cybersecurity technology; and

(2) participation by public utilities in cybersecurity threat information sharing programs.


(c) Incentive-based rate treatmentNot later than 1 year after the completion of the study under subsection (b), the Commission shall establish, by rule, incentive-based, including performance-based, rate treatments for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce by public utilities for the purpose of benefitting consumers by encouraging—(1) investments by public utilities in advanced cybersecurity technology; and
