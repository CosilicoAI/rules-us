Pilot projects; requirements; residue removal credits as compensation; implementation guidelines
The Secretary may carry out pilot wood residue utilization projects under which purchasers of National Forest System timber under contracts awarded prior to October 1, 1986, may, except as otherwise provided in this section, be required to remove wood residues not purchased by them to points of prospective use in return for compensation in the form of “residue removal credits.” Such projects may be carried out where the Secretary identifies situations in which pilot wood residue utilization projects on the National Forest system can provide important information on various methods and approaches to increasing the utilization, in residential, commercial, and industrial or powerplant applications, of wood residues and where such information cannot reasonably be obtained unless the pilot projects are done in conjunction with normal National Forest timber sale activities. The residue removal credits shall be applied against the amount payable for the timber purchased and shall represent the anticipated cost of removal of wood residues. The following guidelines shall apply to projects carried out under this section:(1) Except in cases where wood residue removal is determined to be necessary for fire prevention, site preparation for regeneration, wildlife habitat improvement, or other land management purposes, the Secretary may not provide for removal of wood residues in instances where the anticipated cost of removal would exceed the anticipated value.

(2) The residue removal credits authorized by this section shall not exceed the amount payable by the purchaser for timber after the application of all other designated charges and credits.

(3) The Secretary may sell the wood residues removed to points of prospective use for not less than their appraised value.

(4) Pilot projects, demonstrations, and other programs established pursuant to this subchapter shall be car</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1683_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) Except in cases where wood residue removal is determined to be necessary for fire prevention, site preparation for regeneration, wildlife habitat improvement, or other land management purposes, the Secretary may not provide for removal of wood residues in instances where the anticipated cost of removal would exceed the anticipated value.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1683_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) The residue removal credits authorized by this section shall not exceed the amount payable by the purchaser for timber after the application of all other designated charges and credits.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1683_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) The Secretary may sell the wood residues removed to points of prospective use for not less than their appraised value.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1683_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) Pilot projects, demonstrations, and other programs established pursuant to this subchapter shall be carried out in a manner which does not result in an adverse effect on the furnishing of timber, free of charge, under any other provision of law.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1683_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) Wood residues shall be collected from a site so as to avoid soil depletion or erosion giving full consideration to the protection of wildlife habitat.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1683_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) For the purposes of section 500 of this title, (A) any residue removal credit applied under this section shall be considered as “money received” or “moneys received”, respectively, and (B) the “money received” or “moneys received”, respectively, from the sales of wood residues removed to points of prospective use shall be the proceeds of the sales less the sum of any residue removal credit applied with respect to such residues plus any costs incurred by the Forest Service in processing and storing such residues.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
