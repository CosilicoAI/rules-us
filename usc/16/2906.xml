Terms and conditions of reimbursement
Reimbursements made to the States under section 2905 of this title shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe as being necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the United States. Such terms and conditions shall include, but not be limited to, the following:(1) Each State and each designated State agency shall keep such records as the Secretary shall require as being necessary or appropriate for fully disclosing the amount and purposes of costs incurred by the State for which reimbursement under section 2905 of this title is, or may be, sought. The Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access, for purposes of audit and examination, to such records.

(2) Upon a finding by the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for an agency hearing on the record, that any State has received reimbursement under section 2905 of this title for which it is not eligible, or has violated any term or condition imposed under this section, the State shall thereafter be ineligible to receive reimbursement under such section until restitution satisfactory to the Secretary is made, such violation ceases, or adverse effects resulting from such violation are remedied.
