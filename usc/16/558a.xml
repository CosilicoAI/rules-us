L. 118–234, title III, § 341, Jan. 4, 2025, 138 Stat. 2913, known as the Volunteers in the National Forests and Public Lands Act, which enacted this section and sections 558b to 558g of this title.

Codification
The Volunteers in the National Forests and Public Lands Act, enacting this section and sections 558b to 558g of this title, was orignally enacted as Pub. L. 92–300, May 18, 1972, 86 Stat. 147, known as the Volunteers in the National Forests Act of 1972, which enacted former sections 558a to 558d of this title. Pub. L. 92–300 was amended by Pub. L. 95–289, § 1, June 5, 1978, 92 Stat. 289; Pub. L. 101–286, title II, § 204(a), May 9, 1990, 104 Stat. 175; Pub. L. 103–82, title IV, § 405(d), Sept. 21, 1993, 107 Stat. 921; Pub. L. 114–245, § 4(d)(1), Nov. 28, 2016, 130 Stat. 992. Pub. L. 92–300 was subsequently amended generally by Pub. L. 118–234, title III, § 341, Jan. 4, 2025, 138 Stat. 2913, including an amendment to provide that the Act be cited as the Volunteers in the National Forests and Public Lands Act. Pub. L. 92–300 is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 118–234 without reference to those intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of Pub. L. 92–300 by Pub. L. 118–234.
