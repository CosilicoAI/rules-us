Findings
The Congress finds the following:(1) Three-fourths of all American children and adults participate in wildlife-related recreational activities other than hunting, fishing and trapping.

(2) In 1985, Americans spent over $14 billion on non-consumptive wildlife-related recreation.

(3) The United States and Canada are inhabited by approximately two thousand six hundred vertebrate species of native fish and wildlife, which have provided food, clothing, and other essentials to a rapidly expanding human population.

(4) Over 80 percent of vertebrate fish and wildlife species in North America are not harvested for human use.

(5) The continued well-being of this once-abundant fish and wildlife resource, and even the very existence of many species, is in peril.

(6) In 1967, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service reported that forty-five common migratory bird species, which are not hunted, had exhibited significant declines in abundance, and that thirteen of these species have experienced widespread, systematic declines of 46.9 percent during a twenty-year study period.

(7) There have been nationwide declines in frogs and other amphibians.

(8) Over two hundred and seventy-five of vertebrate fish and wildlife species in the United States are now officially classified as threatened or endangered by the Federal Government.

(9) During the past decade, fish and wildlife species, including invertebrates, were added to the rapidly growing list of threatened and endangered species in North America at the average rate of over one per month.

(10) Currently, eighty-two species of invertebrates in the United States are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.], and another nine hundred and fifty-one United States invertebrate species are candidates for listing under that Act.

(11) Proper management of fish and wildlife, before species become threatened or endangered with extinction, is the key to reversing t</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_1"><akn:num>(1)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(1) Three-fourths of all American children and adults participate in wildlife-related recreational activities other than hunting, fishing and trapping.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_2"><akn:num>(2)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(2) In 1985, Americans spent over $14 billion on non-consumptive wildlife-related recreation.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_3"><akn:num>(3)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(3) The United States and Canada are inhabited by approximately two thousand six hundred vertebrate species of native fish and wildlife, which have provided food, clothing, and other essentials to a rapidly expanding human population.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_4"><akn:num>(4)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(4) Over 80 percent of vertebrate fish and wildlife species in North America are not harvested for human use.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_5"><akn:num>(5)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(5) The continued well-being of this once-abundant fish and wildlife resource, and even the very existence of many species, is in peril.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_6"><akn:num>(6)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(6) In 1967, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service reported that forty-five common migratory bird species, which are not hunted, had exhibited significant declines in abundance, and that thirteen of these species have experienced widespread, systematic declines of 46.9 percent during a twenty-year study period.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_7"><akn:num>(7)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(7) There have been nationwide declines in frogs and other amphibians.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_8"><akn:num>(8)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(8) Over two hundred and seventy-five of vertebrate fish and wildlife species in the United States are now officially classified as threatened or endangered by the Federal Government.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_9"><akn:num>(9)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(9) During the past decade, fish and wildlife species, including invertebrates, were added to the rapidly growing list of threatened and endangered species in North America at the average rate of over one per month.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="subsec_3741_10"><akn:num>(10)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>(10) Currently, eighty-two species of invertebrates in the United States are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.], and another nine hundred and fifty-one United States invertebrate species are candidates for listing under that Act.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:section></akn:body></akn:act></akn:akomaNtoso>
