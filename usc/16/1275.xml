Additions to national wild and scenic rivers system(a) Reports by Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture; recommendations to Congress; contents of reportsThe Secretary of the Interior or, where national forest lands are involved, the Secretary of Agriculture or, in appropriate cases, the two Secretaries jointly shall study and submit to the President reports on the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system of rivers which are designated herein or hereafter by the Congress as potential additions to such system. The President shall report to the Congress his recommendations and proposals with respect to the designation of each such river or section thereof under this chapter. Such studies shall be completed and such reports shall be made to the Congress with respect to all rivers named in section 1276(a) (1) through (27) of this title no later than October 2, 1978. In conducting these studies the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall give priority to those rivers (i) with respect to which there is the greatest likelihood of developments which, if undertaken, would render the rivers unsuitable for inclusion in the national wild and scenic rivers system, and (ii) which possess the greatest proportion of private lands within their areas. Every such study and plan shall be coordinated with any water resources planning involving the same river which is being conducted pursuant to the Water Resources Planning Act [42 U.S.C. 1962 et seq.].
Each report, including maps and illustrations, shall show among other things the area included within the report; the characteristics which do or do not make the area a worthy addition to the system; the current status of land ownership and use in the area; the reasonably foreseeable potential uses of the land and water which would be enhanced, foreclosed, or curtailed if the area were included in the national wild and scenic rivers system; the Federal a</akn:p></akn:content><akn:subsection eId="subsec_1275_a"><akn:num>(a)</akn:num><akn:heading>Reports by Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture; recommendations to Congress; contents of reports</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>(a) Reports by Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture; recommendations to Congress; contents of reports The Secretary of the Interior or, where national forest lands are involved, the Secretary of Agriculture or, in appropriate cases, the two Secretaries jointly shall study and submit to the President reports on the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system of rivers which are designated herein or hereafter by the Congress as potential additions to such system.
